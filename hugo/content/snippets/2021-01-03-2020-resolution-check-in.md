At the start of 2020 [I resolved to communicate publicly 100 times](/snippets/2020-01-01-new-years-resolutions/). How did I do? I got about 80% of the way there.

By the numbers, this is approximately 62 snippets, 8 tech talks, 4 published papers, 1 thesis proposal, 2 videos, and a handful of discussions in public on various Slack-like groups.
