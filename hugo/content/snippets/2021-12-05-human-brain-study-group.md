Interested in casually learning a bit of neuroscience?
Iâ€™m gathering a group to watch / discuss [these lectures (MIT 9.13 The Human Brain, Spring 2019)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP60IKRN_pFptIBxeiMc0MCJP).

Ping me if interested!

Here's how it'll work.

I'll make a Discord.
Each participant will get a channel for dumping notes, thoughts, questions, whatever.
You're free to proceed through the material at your own pace, and are encouraged to share thoughts etc. as you go.

Each week I'll check in with all participants 
to see how far they've gotten and what their goals for the following week are.

We'll have (possibly asynchronous) discussions in Discord,
and every 2 weeks we'll have a synchronous meet up (video/audio chat) with
(a) discussion questions and (b) and chance to ask questions and discuss ideas
with each other.
For these, we'll use whenisgood to choose a time that works for the most people.

We'll continue for 6 weeks (3 synchronous meetups) and then reevaluate if we want to keep scheduling more.

The course has 18 hours of lecture content, 12 weeks of readings, and 8 assignments.
Personally, I plan to spend about 3 hours on this material per week.
So, I'll probably get through the video lectures but none of the other material (but I'll adjust this plan as I go depending on what looks most interesting).
You're welcome to do the same, or to approach the material in a different way as you see fit.

Additionally, when I go to watch the lectures, I'll post that on the Discord too. If folks are available they can join me. I encourage others to do the same, or to meet up to watch lectures in small groups. I find it can be easier to learn when watching with someone else and pausing to discuss periodically.
