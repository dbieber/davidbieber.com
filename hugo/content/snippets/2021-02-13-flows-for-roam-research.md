I wrote three Browserflow flows for Roam Research today. None of them took me more than 20-30 minutes to write. The first one was for saving the current webpage to Roam. I [wrote about that flow here](/snippets/2021-02-13-saving-urls-to-roam-with-browserflow/).

The next flow I wrote is for saving any link you click on to Roam. The idea behind this flow is to prevent doing depth first exploration of the web. Better to look at a bunch of links and then later choose the most interesting, than to dive head first into the first link you click on.

Video of that flow here:

And then I also wrote a flow for saving highlights from any web page to Roam. You can see that flow in action here:

In this flow, whenever I press enter the text I've highlighted is saved to my Roam Research Daily Notes page.
