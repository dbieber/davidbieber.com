Yesterday I added "Discussion" sections to all the snippets and posts on my website.
I wrote [a snippet about it](/snippets/2022-06-20-chat-by-tag) as I was doing it.
The project morphed considerably during the writing of that snippet.
So, today, I'm putting together a shorter snippet that says what I actually did.

I created a Discord server for this website (I invite you to [join the Discord here](https://discord.gg/NJ7ufFuEMa).)
Then, I used widgetbot.io to embed the Discord server all throughout my website.
Every snippet, every post, every tags page, and the [overall snippets](/snippets/) and [overall tags](/tags/) pages all got Discussion sections.

On the Discord server, I made one channel per _tag_ on my website.
The Discussion section for a given page shows the channel for the first tag on that page.
This makes it more likely that you'll encounter a bit of conversation compared with their being a single comments section per page on the site, given the modest level of traffic we're seeing here.

Go ahead and expand the Discussion section below.
Say hi.

See you in the chat.
