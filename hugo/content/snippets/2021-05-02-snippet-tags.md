Recently I added tags to my snippets. Today, I updated the [tags page](/tags/) to display the number of snippets containing the tag. Now I can easily see what topics I write about the most, and which I've written about only a little. Here's where the counts stand today:

- [browserflow (7)](/tags/browserflow/)
- [table tennis (3)](/tags/table-tennis/)
- [automatic-video-editing (7)](/tags/automatic-video-editing/)
- [virtual reality (3)](/tags/virtual-reality/)
- [roam-research (19)](/tags/roam-research/)
- [snippets (20)](/tags/snippets/)
- [tech-tips (6)](/tags/tech-tips/)
- [python (16)](/tags/python/)
- [aspirational-intent (2)](/tags/aspirational-intent/)
- [goals (6)](/tags/goals/)
- [peer-learning-group (7)](/tags/peer-learning-group/)
- [attention (21)](/tags/attention/)
- [taking-silly-ideas-seriously (23)](/tags/taking-silly-ideas-seriously/)
- [Python Fire (4)](/tags/python-fire/)
- [javascript (5)](/tags/javascript/)
- [sql (10)](/tags/sql/)
- [wisdom (2)](/tags/wisdom/)
- [browser-history (10)](/tags/browser-history/)
- [thought-experiments (6)](/tags/thought-experiments/)
- [spaced-repetition (3)](/tags/spaced-repetition/)
- [math (5)](/tags/math/)
- [ask-me-anywhere (2)](/tags/ask-me-anywhere/)
- [Google Apps Script (3)](/tags/google-apps-script/)
- [Automation (3)](/tags/automation/)
- [Just for Fun (3)](/tags/just-for-fun/)
- [Productivity (4)](/tags/productivity/)
- [Software (6)](/tags/software/)
- [Hardware (2)](/tags/hardware/)
- [Puzzle (2)](/tags/puzzle/)
- [Education (6)](/tags/education/)
- [Esperanto (1)](/tags/esperanto/)
- [Princeton ACM (2)](/tags/princeton-acm/)

Looking this over, I think I'd like to normalize the format of the tags. The ones with capital letters at the end date from before I started snippets; those are the tags I used to categorize the projects on my website. I also see I've only written about puzzles twice. Perhaps I'll write about puzzles more. Also, why is there no tag to find all snippets about Bieber Bot? I'll have to fix this.
