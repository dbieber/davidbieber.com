Let's consider machine learning first, and then automation. For each we brainstorm the potential value for note-taking.

### The Value of <mark>Machine Learning</mark> for Note-Taking

- Automatic **transcription** of audio notes
- Automatic **categorization** of notes
- Automatic **categorization of spaced repetition** flash cards
- Automatic **context-filling** of spaced repetition flash cards
    - e.g. highlight a phrase to create a flash card; the necessary context is pulled in from surrounding paragraphs to make a coherent standalone flash card.
- Automatic **connections** and graph construction:
    - Textual elements:
        - Entity extraction from notes ("implicit nodes", e.g. "Bank of America")
        - Attribute extraction from notes (e.g. "incredible presentation by Pierre-Antoine" gets tagged as incredible or wow (the canonical form).)
        - Relationship extraction (e.g. "Diamond Age by Neal Stephenson" -> creates an "author of" relationship)
    - Background knowledge elements:
        - e.g. knowing that Diamond Age is a book
- Writing prompt generator / **Writing assistant**
- **Overlap detection** between people's graphs
    - The Go Note Go "clink" scenario
- **Autocomplete** (e.g. gmail tab completion)
- Improved **spaced repetition algorithms**
- Mistake detection / **fact checking**
- **Summarization** of notes
- **Highlight extraction** from notes
- Suggesting **new ideas**
- Suggesting **new online resources** to read / explore
    - Incl. articles, papers, YouTube videos, Suggesting **people to reach out to** (e.g. because of their blog or Twitter or other things they're written)
- Suggesting **people to reach out to** (e.g. because of their blog or Twitter or other things they're written
- **Semantic search**
- **Conversational chat bots** for exploring the knowledge in a notebase


### The Value of <mark>Automation</mark> for Note-Taking

- **Share notes** with people via their preferred messaging platform
- **Snooze notes** and ideas so you review them later
- Set pomodoros, alarms, and reminders to **stay focused** and **stay on task**
- Note-taking **via highlights** (e.g. with Browserflow)
- Note-taking **via screenshots** (e.g. from YouTube)
- Automatic creation of **spaced repetition from highlights**
- **Bulk refactors** of note-taking
- **Pulling in context** from other sources (e.g. Warmly pulls LinkedIn info into Calendar, notes could pull info from wikipedia)
- **Sync notes** between other sources and your notebase
    - Other people's notes
    - Your email client, calendar, TODO app, spaced repetition app, GitHub issues, other messaging services, etc
- **Publishing** of notes to a webpage (either publicly or privately), or to social media
- New **data entry** mechanisms: **Go Note Go**, terminal, email, text, browsing history, location history, terminal history, IoT devices, etc
- **Spaced repetition** for studying
- **Inactivity reminders** (e.g. "it's been three months since you've done a music activity", or "it's been over 6 months since you've spoken with David Dohan", or "it's been over a year since you've written about microbiology.")
