How to qualify for the US Olympic table tennis team.

1. Become the best singles table tennis player in the country, preferably by a significant margin
2. Enter the qualifiers
3. Win the qualifiers

This is far more straightforward than I would have expected. Obviously step 1 presents a significant challenge, and step 2 probably involves some paperwork. Still, it came as a shock to me that a single tournament, open to any USATT player as far as I can tell, which only gets 50 entrants, is all that stands between an aspirational table tennis player and such a significant event as the Olympics.

On to step 1!
