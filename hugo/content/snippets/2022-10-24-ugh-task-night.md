Boo! ðŸ‘» Ugh Task Night is coming!

This is the second year I'm hosting Ugh Task Night, the scariest night of the year. Ugh Task Night takes place in late October, right around that other spooky holiday.
At Ugh Task Night, friends come together for an evening to do the scariest thing of all, their Ugh Tasks. We gather (virtually, on GatherTown) and, interspersed with chatting, do the things we dread most of all, generally to a feeling of significant relief. By doing our Ugh Tasks with friends, in a setting of care and support, we can face our inner beasts and try to tame them.
At UTN, people perform their Ugh Tasks independently, together.

What's an Ugh Task? An Ugh Task is something you have to do, but which you've been putting off, such that now even the thought of it causes you to recoil a little with dread.
Maybe it's an email you need to send, or an appointment you need to schedule. Maybe it's a text you fear even reading, or something you said you'd have done long ago that you still haven't finished. Often the ugh feeling that an Ugh Task elicits causes you to put off the task further, worsening the ugh feeling that it elicits -- an ugly downward cycle.

Whatever your Ugh Task may be, it's welcome at Ugh Task Night.

A few more notes on the hosting of Ugh Task Night:

* Should people RSVP? There is no "should". And I don't ask people to RSVP. The point isn't to create more work for them. I do enjoy knowing who's coming though, so RSVPing is totally optional.
* Can people invite their friends? This year I went with yes! I told folks they are welcome to invite others, _especially_ anyone they've been meaning to see for years but haven't gotten around to reaching out to yet. i.e. In the spirit of the night, they can use Ugh Task Night as a tool to complete a possible social Ugh Task.
