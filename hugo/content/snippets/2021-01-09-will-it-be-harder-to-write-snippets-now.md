Now that I've [linked to the snippets section from my main website](/post/2021-01-08-where-are-all-the-posts-from-2020/), will it be harder to write snippets? I hope not. I'll have to make an even more concerted effort to lower the quality bar though.

The goal, as always, is for the snippets section to avoid any inhibitions. Writing here should be as easy as thinking aloud. A tiny post like this ought to help in this regard.
