I've set up a GitHub action to enable even faster automatic publishing of snippets from Roam. This is a test-snippet I'm using while writing the auto-publisher.

Let's see how it behaves if I'm editing an existing snippet routinely for a while.

If it works as intended, the snippet will update itself on GitHub after I stop typing for several seconds. I've now stopped typing, we'll see what happens.
