Whoa! Hello there! Can't wait to learn what you can do!<br/>

I say "Can you check the time for me?" and you walk over to a clock and look at it.<br/>

Can you see how much shampoo is left?<br/>
Send me a picture of what's in the fridge.<br/>
Take out the trash.<br/>
Check if the milk is spoiled and put it in the trash.<br/>
Very gently move the jigsaw puzzle into the other room.<br/>
Quick! Unplug the toaster!<br/>

Put out the fire.<br/>
Can you plug my phone in, please?<br/>
Open the window?<br/>

Let's rearrange the furniture -- where do you think the couch should go?<br/>
Can you check what page I was on in my book? I think it's on the couch.<br/>
Can you help me find my keys?<br/>

Help me install this sconce.<br/>
Make the bed.<br/>
Do the dishes.<br/>
Clean the counter.<br/>
Vaccuum the carpet.<br/>

Can you open the blinds for me in the morning?<br/>
Please have breakfast ready at 8am.<br/>
Do you remember if I brushed my teeth yet?<br/>

Let's work out together.<br/>
Let's dance.<br/>
Now, let's play a board game.<br/>
Can you write a letter?<br/>
Can you write a letter in my handwriting??<br/>

Put on this motion capture device, we're going to calibrate you.<br/>
Bring me my own motion capture device -- I want to collect some practice demonstrations for you.<br/>
I seem to have left my motion capture device in New Haven, so watch carefully -- I'm going to show you how I clean the mirror.<br/>

First I pick up this bottle, and I make sure the spray nozzle is set to the on position. It says "On" here.<br/>
Then I point the bottle at the mirror and spray like this, pulling the trigger to spray.<br/>
I wipe the wet off the mirror to remove any dirt that built up.<br/>
Now you try.<br/>
Oh, the way I know if I succeeded is the mirror looks clean!<br/>
Give it a few tries. You'll figure it out.<br/>

Oh wow, you got it on your first try -- I guess this isn't a new skill for you?<br/>
Oh, someone taught you on a different mirror somewhere else around the world, so you already knew how to do this.<br/>
But you still had to figure out how to do it in this new environment, and you did great!<br/>

Can you clean up the mess you made when you dropped that plate earlier?<br/>
Ouch! You rolled over the dog's tail!<br/>
Negative reward! "No", "No...", "Bad robot..."<br/>

"Very good!"<br/>

Oh wow, thank you for this unprompted gift -- yes, you get reward for that, that was wonderful, that was very kind.<br/>

Thank you for the elbow pat, little robot.<br/>

Don't forget to oil your joints!<br/>
Let's order some new oil for you.<br/>

Hmm, encoding your reward to just my voice doesn't seem sufficient with the hacks going around -- we'll need a password or 2fa chip as well.<br/>
What a shame.<br/>

Does it make you sad that I'm thinking about buying a newer model?<br/>
I'm gonna miss you everyday, Robbie.<br/>
