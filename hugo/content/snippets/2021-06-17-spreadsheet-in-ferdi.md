Can I put a spreadsheet into Ferdi? I don't see why not. I think if it works well I would want to put my After Work Activities and Automatic Transaction Log spreadsheets into Ferdi so they're always available at my fingertips.

It's silly that Chrome doesn't offer tab freezing. Maybe it does. Ferdi's hibernation seems less memory hungry than having extra tabs open in Chrome, but perhaps this is wrong. Chrome doesn't really handle special keyboard-shortcut bound tabs organization super well anyway though. The new cmd-option-a search tabs feature is nice though. Maybe that can let me move some tabs to chrome instead of Ferdi.
