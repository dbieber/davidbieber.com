### pyd-swyt; cf-bh-din

It's pronounced just like it's spelled ("pied, swite, cuff, buh-din"). It's my life motto.
And I think these are good principles to live by. Here they are:

1. Pursue your dreams.
1. Say what you think.
1. Cultivate friendships.
1. Be happy.
1. Do it now.

I think each of these is self-explanatory. Briefly though, let's consider each.

### Pursue Your Dreams

Work toward long term goals you think are worthwhile.
It's easy to fall into the trap of chasing promotions and paychecks, so the "pyd" in pyd-swyt serves as a reminder to never lose sight of your dreams.

### Say What You Think

It can be easier to go along with the status quo than to voice dissent.
It can be easier to assume others are correct than to voice confusion.
Usually though, it is better to express your dissent / confusion / support.
The "swyt" in pyd-swyt serves as a constant reminder to speak your mind, especially when it would be more comfortable not to do so.

### Cultivate Friendships

Reach out to people you care about, and to people you want to know better.
Reconnect with those you haven't seen in a long time, rather than losing touch with them gradually.
Time spent with friends is time well-spent, so the "cf" in "cf-bh-din" stands as a reminder to cultivate friendships.

### Be Happy

Do the things you love, and do them often.
Spend time with the people you care about.
Do what makes you happy.
Don't sacrifice these things for your other values.
"bh"; be happy.

### Do It Now

These are principles for now.
Don't wait to pursue your dreams.
Don't wait to say what you think.
Don't wait to cultivate friendships.
Certainly don't wait to be happy.
Do each of these things every day, starting now.
