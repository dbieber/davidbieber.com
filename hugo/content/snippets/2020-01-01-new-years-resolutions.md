I've set New Year's Resolutions most years for the last several years. Let's review:


| Year | Resolution | Status| Result |
|------|------------|-------|--------|
|2019|Play violin on 100 days | Played on 43 days | <font color="maroon">Nope</font> |
|2018|  |  |  |
|2017|Longer arms|  | <font color="green">Yesssss!</font> |
|2016|  |  |  |
|2015|Exercise 200 days<br> Read 200 days | Exercise: 200 days by summer<br> Reading: (look this up) | Yes. |
|2014|  |  |  |
|2013|100 days of push ups | 145 done by December | <font color="green">Yes!</font> |


The missing entries I don't recall or have readily available, but I had goals in those years too.

This year, I add a new resolution to the table:

|Year|Resolution|Status| Result |
|----|----------|------|--------|
|2020| Communicate publicly 100 times | \*\*Finger's crossed\*\* | TBD! |

What counts as "communicating publicly"?

- A [snippet](/snippets) like this one
- Giving a tech talk
- Writing a [blog post](/posts)
- Publishing a paper
- Uploading a video

You can expect fewer than one email per month, not 100 per year, so don't worry about spam.
