I've now written several snippets about my analyzing my browsing history programmatically. I figured I'd collect them all in one place here.

Presumably as I write more about this, the list will go out of date. And that's alright. This is just a snippet.

This motivates me to move all my snippets into Roam Research. I'm not going to do this just yet, but it seems a decent idea. Backlinks/tags would then allow for easily keeping an up-to-date list of all the snippets I've written about various topics.

Looking back on these many browsing history snippets, what themes stand out? Browser histories are rich with information about our lives. There's a lot we can do to make our lives better using that information.

We can detect if we're getting distracted, and have automated interventions if we are.

We can figure out our interests, and notice if they're drifting over time.

We can reflect on things we've learned or thought about in the past, revisiting our old ideas. This can help generate new ideas, and also strengthen our memory.

I've made some progress on automated distraction detection. I'll have to write a snippet about that soon. I've also recently poked at getting my browsing history from my phone on my computer, so that can be analyzed in near real-time too. This promises to make distraction detection even more compelling. Very excited to teach Bieber Bot how to stage a distraction intervention some time in the next year.
