I'd like to add margin notes to my website. [^1]
I'd also like to learn how to use Fiverr. [^2]
So, I'm going to hire someone on Fiverr to add margin notes on my website.

[^1]: I'd like this to be a margin note. At the time of this writing, it's a footnote.

[^2]: I've used it twice before, but I didn't have a great experience with the one programmer I hired.

Fabian, over at capnfabs.net, has an [excellent post](https://capnfabs.net/posts/margin-notes-hugo-theme/) where he adds margin notes to his own hugo blog. We'll be using that for guidance.

After my Fiverr experience I'll update this snippet or add a new one, ideally one full of margin notes.
