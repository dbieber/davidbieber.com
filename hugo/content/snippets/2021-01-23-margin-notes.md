I'd like to add margin notes to my website. [^1]
I'd also like to learn how to use Fiverr. [^2]
So, I'm going to hire someone on Fiverr to add margin notes on my website.

[^1]: I'd like this to be a margin note. At the time of this writing, it's a footnote. *Update*: Now it's a margin note! At least if your browser is wide enough... otherwise it's still a footnote.

[^2]: I've used it twice before, but I didn't have a great experience with the one programmer I hired.

Fabian, over at capnfabs.net, has an [excellent post](https://capnfabs.net/posts/margin-notes-hugo-theme/) where he adds margin notes to his own hugo blog. We'll be using that for guidance.

After my Fiverr experience I'll update this snippet or add a new one, ideally one full of margin notes.

Update (same day): I'm back! I didn't use Fiverr. I used the post on capnfabs for reference and set up margin notes myself. Thank you Fabian for documenting your process. [^3] I'll have to learn to use Fiverr another day.

[^3]: Really, it is greatly appreciated! üôè

I'm glad to have this working. There's room to improve the style though. Perhaps in a future iteration I'll move the main content left to give more space for the margin notes, or make some changes to the font and size.
