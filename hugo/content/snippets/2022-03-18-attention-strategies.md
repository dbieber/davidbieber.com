Lately I've sometimes had trouble focusing. My attention will sometimes drift to one of the internet's [infinite distractions](/snippets/2020-10-01-infinite-distractions-and-getting-a-good-sear/).
I've made a list of strategies I use to combat this, to better align my attention with my intentions.

1. Using an outliner like Roam Research (see [these snippets](/tags/roam-research))
1. Working with another person (e.g. pair programming)
1. Working with another person present (e.g. independent coworking)
1. Running a ["distraction detection" program](/snippets/2021-01-09-mobile-distraction-detection-at-last/)
1. Mentally noting the distraction-kind and returning my attention
1. Keeping [my phone in my kitchen](/snippets/2021-07-08-phone-in-kitchen/)
1. Writing on [Go Note Go](/projects/go-note-go/), my headless keyboard
1. Attending meetings/talks in "clamshell mode" (laptop closed, no keyboard or mouse available)
1. Making TODO lists
1. And explicitly writing down the ^^active TODO^^
1. Going to sleep at a __specific__ time (e.g. [10:10pm](/snippets/2021-04-20-sleep-no-snippet/))
1. Exercising regularly (or at least [aiming to](/tags/table-tennis/))
1. Stopping watching TV in the middle of an episode (ends of episodes are more addicting)
1. 50 minute working sessions (e.g. [focusmate.com](https://focusmate.com))
1. Stretching
1. Taking short deliberate breaks
1. Using Pomodoro timers for working sessions
1. Using the ["Intention"](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/intention-stop-mindless-b/dladanhaondcgpahgiflodhckhoeohoe) Chrome extension by DK
1. Keeping all notifications on my phone turned off
1. Asking the people I live with to get my attention first before starting a conversation with me
1. Announcing my current active goal publicly (e.g. in a chat room)
1. [“Hide feed”](https://www.hidefeed.com/) Chrome extension, also by DK
