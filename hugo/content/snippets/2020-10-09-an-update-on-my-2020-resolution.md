My goal for this year was to get good at communicating publicly. I decided to measure progress in terms of the number of times I communicated publicly. 100 public communications was the goal. Where am I today?

This is my 42nd snippet for the year. I'm giving a talk on Python Fire publicly next week. I published 4 papers (IPA-GNN, TF-Coder, Unique Randomizer, and BUSTLE). So far two of them have been accompanied by open source releases.

Add in a handful of paper presentations and Google-internal talks, and its safe to say I'm past the half-way point toward the goal. Only trouble is we're over 75% of the way through the year. I'd better get communicating!
