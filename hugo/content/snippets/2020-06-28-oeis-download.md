If you're looking for a way to download the entire [Online Encylopedia of Integer Sequences](https://oeis.org/), you may come across advice for scraping the site, one sequence at a time. Instead of collecting the sequences one at a time, it might be sufficient to download one of their already collected archives. [This file](https://oeis.org/stripped.gz) contains the integer sequences and their A-numbers, and [this file](https://oeis.org/names.gz) contains the names of the sequences. No need to stress the OEIS servers when these ready-made archives are ripe for downloading!

I found these files from [this page](https://oeis.org/wiki/JSON_Format,_Compressed_Files) of the OEIS wiki. The reason I'm linking to it here is that finding that page was difficult, and I hope to save you the trouble of finding it for yourself.
