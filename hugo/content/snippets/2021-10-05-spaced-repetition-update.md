Previously I've written about [how I do spaced repetition in Roam Research](/snippets/2021-01-02-spaced-repetition-in-roam-research/) using Leitner Boxes. I'm still doing spaced repetition daily, but my methods have changed a bit. So, let me give you the update.

I'm still doing spaced repetition in Roam, but I've moved away from the Leitner Box approach. Now instead I use [Adam Krivka's roam/sr](https://github.com/aidam38/roamsr). With this approach, each card has it's own review schedule instead of being lumped together into a small total number of review buckets. Also, the review process is nicer looking and lower friction (especially on mobile) compared to my original Leitner Box approach.

I made the switch to roam/sr on July 5, and haven't missed a day since. It's been three months so far. Let's keep it up! In that time, I've created 1383 cards. That's 15 new cards a day.

The main way in which I make cards these days is with my [Browserflow Note-taking Flow](/snippets/2021-07-29-note-taking-flow/). With this flow, I highlight _part_ of a sentence or paragraph and press c (for a sentence) or b (for a paragraph) to turn that sentence or paragraph  into a "cloze" task. The highlighted part becomes a fill-in-the-blank and the whole sentence/paragraph becomes a card in my spaced repetition system.

I'm also using Adam Krivka's [image occlusion plugin](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/roam-depot-developers/page/fIR-UkBAL) for Roam to create visual cloze tasks. With it, I'll mask out part of an image to create a spaced repetition card asking me to predict what's missing in the image.

I'm mainly using spaced repetition to study Croatian. I also have plenty of cards relating to medicine, astrophysics, economics, science in the news, computer science and machine learning, math, and more. There's a long tail of topics I dove into, taking notes with Browserflow, that now populate my cards.

A typical review session is about 50-80 cards, with a couple of days peaking over 100 cards. I add cards in clusters, so my "new cards" pile varies from having 0 cards to having about 100 cards. I limit myself to studying 25 new cards per day, occasionally allowing this to reach up to 50 or 75.

Spaced repetition has become a morning habit for me. Usually the first thing I do each morning is a review session, whereas I more often make new cards at night. Though I've kept the habit up for over 90 days consecutively (and have been doing SRS for over a year now off-and-on), I expect the real challenge to my habit will come the next time I travel extensively. Hopefully by being aware of this challenge now, I'll be able to keep the habit through it in the future.
