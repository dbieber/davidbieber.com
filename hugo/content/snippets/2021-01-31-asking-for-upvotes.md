Hello! Can I let you know when I post new content? In particular, can I let you know when I post things to e.g. Hacker News, which require upvotes to be seen? This should go without saying: there's no pressure to actually upvote anything -- but if you think my submission deserves it and you do upvote it, that's much appreciated!

If _Yes_, let me know. You can let me know [on Facebook messenger](https://www.messenger.com/t/dbieber), or you can fill out this form. Info about the _content-sharing group_ option below the fold.

"What's a _content-sharing group_?", you may be wondering. It's a small Facebook messenger group where the social norm is to share your creative output. This is a place to share things you've made, posts you've written, or progress updates on your latest side-project. All sharing of this kind is welcome. Feel free to brag. Incremental updates are welcome too, so there's no need to wait until a project is finished. It's not spamming; it's what the group is for! To join, just let me know or fill out the form and I'll add you.
