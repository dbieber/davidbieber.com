The last two years I've mostly been writing snippets, but today I wrote [a new post](/post/2022-01-08-new-messager-setup). Why?

I initially wrote it as a snippet.
And the total time it took to write was short, like a snippet, not long like a typical post.
So there are reasons to think it is not unlike other snippets.

The reason I chose to publish it as a post rather than as a snippet is it seemed more significant.
The last few days, playing with all the progress I've made in Go Note Go and Messager, left me wanting to share my work with other people. So, by publishing it as a post, it will be more prominent on my website, and over time more people will see it.

Another small reason is I hadn't made a post in a long time. By converting this snippet into a post, I maintain a pattern of periodic posting of posts. When someone (likely me) looks at the list of post dates, there won't be a large gap, even if I don't write another post for a year.
So, I suppose I wanted to remove any internal pressure for writing posts that may have been building up.
At first I thought that describing this reason, I would end by noting that it's a shallow reason;
after all, the appearance of consistent posting feels like a shallow thing to me.
Now that I've written it out though, I realize it's more about managing the expectations set by a small shallow piece of me, not just about conceding to that piece.
It is, in part, me conceding to that piece though.

Finally -- last reason -- it had the right heft and length to feel OK as a post.

Cheers.
