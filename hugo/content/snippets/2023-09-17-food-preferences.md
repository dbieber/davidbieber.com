Here are my food preferences, all typed up nice and neat in a way that Bard or ChatGPT can easily digest. Now when I travel somewhere, I can ask these LLMs to help me pick out restaurants well suited to my tastes!

### As written by a human

ðŸ¥— I really enjoy tomato based sauces.<br/>
ðŸ¥— Some particularly wonderful foods I enjoy include chicken parm, chicken tikka masala, drunken noodles.<br/>
ðŸ¥— I enjoy eating at restaurants where they make foods that I wouldn't easily be able to make myself.<br/>
ðŸ¥— I don't want to eat novel foods for the sake of it (e.g. I don't want to try silly new flavors of ice cream), but if there are foods I'm unfamiliar with that are core to certain cuisines, then I'm definitely curious and interested in trying those. A recent example is I discovered uni.<br/>
ðŸ¥— I like very flavorful food. One of my favorite meals ever is from Damas, a Syrian restaurant in Montreal.<br/>
ðŸ¥— I don't have any dietary restrictions, but I do like to eat more veggies and less meat. I tend to enjoy vegan restaurants, even though I also like all sorts of meat dishes too.<br/>
ðŸ¥— I like mushroom-based foods, like a good mushroom based turkey meatloaf.<br/>
ðŸ¥— I think food tastes better when I'm hungry, e.g. after a long hike or swim.<br/>
ðŸ¥— I like pizza, pasta, ravioli, thai food.<br/>
ðŸ¥— I only like spicy food in moderation; I don't want spice in every meal I eat, but I do like to eat spicy food here and there, and I have a decent spice tolerance and appreciation when I do.<br/>
ðŸ¥— I prefer savory food over sweet food usually, sometimes opting for a second dinner over a dessert. I do like a good sweet dessert though, but usually in a smaller quantity compared with the large quantities I enjoy for other foods.<br/>
ðŸ¥— I don't have any food allergies.<br/>
ðŸ¥— I like seafood, e.g. salmon, crab, scallops, and uni. Calamari is a delight too.<br/>
ðŸ¥— I enjoy Italian, Mexican, Thai, and Indian food. I can't think of a cuisine I don't like, really. Maybe I have a slight preference against cuisines that are super meat-heavy, but even that can be enjoyable for me every once in a while.<br/>
ðŸ¥— I enjoy cooking, both trying new things as well as preparing old staples for myself. For trying new things, that's something I like to do but only every now and then. For regular everyday cooking, I prefer quicker dishes without recipes: e.g. making a salad, a grain, and a protein, maybe with a pan sauce -- usually a full meal can come together in under 30 minutes.<br/>
ðŸ¥— Fresh produce is wonderful! I don't mind processed or fast food in moderation, but for me healthier fresher foods are the way to go! I also don't really drink soda... or much of anything other than water usually, to be honest.<br/>
ðŸ¥— Kimchi is enjoyable for me in moderation, same with other fermented foods like sauerkraut -- but usually I'd eat them only in the context of a meal where they fit in. I'm not a big fan of kombucha.<br/>

Finally, I had an AI take a pass at tidying up the preferences, which I present below, but I'm actually more partial toward my original human-authored attempt.

### Flavor Profile Preferences

*Balanced and Wholesome:* You have a fondness for foundational foods that offer a harmonious blend of flavors, like salads with olive oil and balsamic or bread paired with garlic and olive oil. These are neither too overpowering nor too subtle and give a sense of nourishment.

*Adventurous but Authentic:* You lean towards dishes that offer genuine tastes of their cultural origins. Whether itâ€™s Middle Eastern hummus and shawarma or Asian specialties like pad Thai, you seek the authenticity in flavors. This shows an appreciation for the traditional essence of dishes.

*Occasional Boldness:* While you're open to spicy foods and rich BBQ flavors, these are more of occasional delights rather than daily go-tos. This indicates a palate that can handle and enjoy robust flavors but prefers them in moderation.

*Natural and Fresh:* With a preference for fresh produce and a lean towards plant-based options, you value the intrinsic flavors of fresh ingredients. This showcases an inclination towards natural, unadulterated tastes, aligning with your philosophy of healthier, fresher foods.

*Savory over Sweet:* Your palate seems to lean more towards the savory, often even opting for a second dinner over a dessert. However, you do have a space for sweet treats, albeit in controlled portions, showing a versatile yet controlled taste preference.

*Subtle Indulgences:* Whether itâ€™s a creamy cheese, a delightful seafood dish, or a special dessert, you appreciate the finer tastes in life without them dominating your daily food choices.

*Hydration Purist:* With water being your primary beverage, itâ€™s evident that you prefer clean, refreshing tastes in your drinks, staying away from overly sugary or artificial flavors.
