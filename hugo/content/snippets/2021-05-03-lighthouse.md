[web.dev](https://web.dev/measure/) (former known as Lighthouse) is a tool for measuring your website's performance and getting tips for how to improve it. I'm in the process of following some of it's suggestions right now.

*Working session*

One of web.dev's suggestions was to enable gzip compression of the pages on my website.

Tornado supports this, but only starting at version 4.0 and newer. I'm on an older version.

I cannot seem to pip install a newer version.

I cannot update pip.

I cannot install Python 3.

Why?
