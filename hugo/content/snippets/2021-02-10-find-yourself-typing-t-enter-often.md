 A common attention pitfall is to mindless type cmd-t t ENTER. cmd-t creates a new tab. "t" autocompletes to twitter.com. ENTER. Four keystrokes and you're scrolling. "r" for reddit. "f" for facebook. etc.

Less than a second of mindless activity, leading to hundreds of seconds (minutes? hours?) of scrolling that you didn't intend to do.

Here's the solution. **Delete websites from your browser's autocomplete.**

It's easy to do. On Mac, it's **fn-shift-delete**. On Windows, just shift-delete.

Just select the website from Chrome's dropdown and press fn-shift-delete, and the website is removed from your browser's autocomplete.

[In Firefox, it's even easier](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/remove-websites-address-bar-suggestions): just press shift-delete.

Eventually the websites will make them back into your autocomplete, but it will take awhile for this to happen. And when it does, now you know what to do: fn-shift-delete.
