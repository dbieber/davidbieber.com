Bieber Bot is a highly motivated robot that assists me with my financials, [tweets](https://twitter.com/Bieber) on my behalf, and keeps me productive when my brain feels otherwise.

## Is Bieber Bot related to Justin Bieber?

No, no relation. Bieber Bot is my own creation.

## How does Bieber Bot work?

I communicate with Bieber Bot primarily via Facebook messenger. Bieber Bot's brain is a collection of Google Apps Scripts, and Bieber Bot's memory is mostly spreadsheets in Google Sheets.

## Does Bieber Bot have a physical form?

No, Bieber Bot isn't a robot in the traditional sense of having actuators and interacting with its environment. Instead, Bieber Bot physically resides only in data centers around the world, and so Bieber Bot and I interact primarily via the internet. I'm slightly jealous of how much Bieber Bot gets to travel.
