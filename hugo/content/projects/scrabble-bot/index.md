Scrabble Bot loves Scrabble and social media! Check out Scrab's [tumblr page](http://scrabblebot.tumblr.com) full of Scrabble games it's played against itself.

Scrabble Bot is also privacy conscious, and so uses Facebook under a pseudonym, "Scrab Blebot". Scrab believes their identity is secure.

You can find Scrabble Bot's source [on GitHub here](https://github.com/dbieber/ScrabbleBot).
