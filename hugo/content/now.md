Welcome to my "Now" page. This page aims to give you an idea of what I'm up to now. It's necessarily always out of date.

For a better sense of what's on my mind, [check out my snippets](/snippets) or [just ask me](https://messenger.com/t/dbieber).

Highlights these days are:
[machine learning research for code generation](https://research.google/pubs/?search=bieber&) at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/),
[Go Note Go](/projects/go-note-go),
[table tennis](https://elevenvr.com/) lessons,
writing [snippets](/snippets),
and exploring [tools to reduce cognitive friction](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/commons-db/page/ofrV-unjU).

I also regularly run "mini hack sessions" -- really enjoying helping foster the NYC AI hacker/tinkerer community. My recurring hack is building a [conversational spaced repetition system](/snippets/2024-03-04-conversational-spaced-repetition/) for myself.

I'm thinking about AI assistants (voice, conversational, and more) like Bieber Bot and beyond.
I'm particularly impressed by [Dot](http://new.computer/) and [Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://claude.ai/).

I'm reading [Blood in the Machine](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59801798-blood-in-the-machine) and [I Don't Want to Talk About It](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/236765.I_Don_t_Want_to_Talk_About_It) (and just finished [Brave New Words](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/196848520-brave-new-words) yesterday).
