Welcome to my "Now" page. This page aims to give you an idea of what I'm up to now. It's necessarily always out of date.

For a better sense of what's on my mind, [check out my snippets](/snippets) or [just ask me](https://messenger.com/t/dbieber).

Highlights these days are:
[Learning for code machine learning research](https://research.google/pubs/?collection=learning-for-code) at [Google DeepMind](https://research.google/teams/brain/) and [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/),
[Go Note Go](/projects/go-note-go) and [Messager](/post/2022-01-08-new-messager-setup/),
[table tennis](https://elevenvr.com/),
writing [snippets](/snippets),
and exploring [tools to reduce cognitive friction](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/commons-db/page/ofrV-unjU).

Thinking about AI assistants (voice and conversational) like Bieber Bot and beyond.
ChatGPT and GPT-4 are the most exciting technologies I've ever had the pleasure of using.
Since November, I routinely have waves of AI-induced anxiety.

I'm reading [Pride and Prejudice](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1885.Pride_and_Prejudice) and [The Decipherment of Linear B](https://www.goodreads.com/hu/book/show/384070).

I'm also preparing to defend my PhD on May 15. Wish me luck!
