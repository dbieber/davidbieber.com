Welcome to my "Now" page. This page aims to give you an idea of what I'm up to now. It's necessarily always out of date.

For a better sense of what's on my mind, [check out my snippets](/snippets) or [just ask me](https://messenger.com/t/dbieber).

Highlights these days are:
[teaching Claude to program](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code) at [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/),
[Go Note Go](/projects/go-note-go),
writing short stories, focusing on fitness, and side-projecting.

I'm semi-regularly running "mini hack sessions", and with the advent of Claude Code and "vibe coding" I'm building more adhoc side projects than ever before.
One I'm particularly excited for is for Claude to start buying me books.

I'm thinking about screenless programming assistants (both with voice and keyboard inputs), as the [first of my nine dreams](/snippets/2023-07-31-pursue-your-dreams/) nears reality.

I'm reading [What is Life?](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222531818-what-is-life) and [Adundance](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/176444106-abundance), and most recently read [If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/228646231-if-anyone-builds-it-everyone-dies).
