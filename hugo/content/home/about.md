I am a software engineer and researcher in <a href="https://g.co/brain">Google Brain</a>, where I focus my efforts on machine learning for program synthesis. Concurrently I am pursuing my PhD studies at University of Montreal in the same field.

My group focuses on deep learning techniques for the synthesis of programs from scratch and for synthesizing edits to existing programs. I am particularly interested in graph neural networks, the intersection of programming languages and machine learning, learning about software systems, multimodal learning, and applications of machine learning to help students, developers, and non-technical end users.
