If you've taken any online classes, read on! Online education is growing rapidly, and I want to make the online education experience the best it can be. To that end, I would really appreciate your insight regarding online courses such as those offered at Coursera, Udacity, edX, Khan Academy, and MIT's OpenCourseWare.

Please help me by [filling out this short 4 question form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEFYRE1OVmFaQ1doTEoyZV9teG13eGc6MQ) regarding your online education experiences:

The questions asked are: "Which platforms have you used?" "Tell me a bit about yourself." "How do you take notes on video lectures?" and "Tell me more!"

Pretty open ended, I recognize. And I'd love to hear what you have to say.
