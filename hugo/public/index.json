Do you pull over, pull out your phone or moleskin, and write it down? Nay. Go Note Go to the rescue.\nWhile driving, simply press the large handheld red push button and speak your idea aloud. It will be automatically transcribed and added to your notes once an internet connection becomes available.\nGo Note Go is the latest in my line1 of headless keyboard technologies, the successor to shh shell (2014). As with shh shell, no visual components are required to operate Go Note Go. You control the system only via audio or, optionally, by typing. Unlike with shh shell, it is inadvisable to keep your eyes closed while you use it, particularly if you are driving.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s dive deeper now into what is Go Note Go, and what it brings to the note-taking space beyond shh.\nWhat is Go Note Go? Physically, Go Note Go is a lightweight portable keyboard with a microphone and speaker, with a beautiful handheld button attached. The keyboard is a Raspberry Pi 400 \u0026ndash; so, it\u0026rsquo;s also a full computer with WiFi, Bluetooth, and a friendly Linux operating system.\nIt can be powered by USB-C either from a small battery pack that velcros to the back, from a port in your car, a port on your main computer, or a standard outlet.\nWhat does Go Note Go do? Go Note Go allows audio and text note-taking, as well as arbitrary audio and text command execution. Let\u0026rsquo;s focus on note-taking first. We\u0026rsquo;ll return to command execution later.\nThere are two main ways to enter notes with Go Note Go (audio and text), corresponding to the two main use cases (driving and camping). The use cases of shh shell (sleeping and showering) are both still supported.\n Driving Camping Sleeping Showering  To enter notes via audio, simply press the large red handheld push button. Then speak your notes. The recording will be saved. When internet connectivity becomes available, your audio will be automatically machine transcribed and included in your note-taking system of choice.\nTo enter notes via text, type them. Press enter to commit a note. Press shift-backspace to clear the currently typed text. When internet connectivity becomes available, your notes will be uploaded to your central note-taking system.\nTaking notes by audio is great for driving, or for whenever speaking better suits your way of thinking than typing. Being able to seamlessly go back and forth between speaking and typing can be liberating, allowing for alternating different kinds of thinking.\nThe system is compact and portable.\nIt velcros to the passenger side of the car dashboard. It can be used there, or placed on a passenger’s lap during use, or even on the driver’s lap at a rest stop, waiting in line at a drive-thru, or while parked.\nIt can be powered by the car by USB-C, or by battery pack for use on the go (or from a laptop or outlet USB port, if that better suits your use).\nYou can lie down with it and type or talk.\nOr throw it in your sports bag to take notes on the game!\nHow do you use Go Note Go in the shower? To use Go Note Go in the shower, acquire a waterproof Bluetooth enabled keyboard, and pair it with your Go Note Go Raspberry Pi 400. Go ahead and leave that waterproof keyboard in your shower.\nFor an improved experience, also acquire a waterproof Bluetooth speaker for your shower, and pair this with the Pi as well.\nNow, your Pi simply has to be in range of your shower for you to use Go Note Go when generating your most groundbreaking insights.\nNo additional setup is required. Run the \u0026ldquo;:status\u0026rdquo; command to verify everything is working before typing a note to ensure it doesn\u0026rsquo;t get lost.\nImprovements over Shh Shell Go Note Go supports audio notes and audio commands, whereas shh shell only supported text entry. If you\u0026rsquo;re trying to fall asleep, text is less likely to wake up your mind, but if you\u0026rsquo;re driving, text is incredibly dangerous.\nGo Note Go works offline and without a laptop nearby. To use shh shell, your keyboard needs to be connected wirelessly to a nearby computer running the shh shell software. Go Note Go\u0026rsquo;s keyboard is a computer, and it can be powered by battery pack, from a laptop, from an outlet, or from the car. Your notes will be uploaded to your main note-taking system as soon as internet connectivity becomes available.\nNo need for \u0026ldquo;focused\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;focus lost\u0026rdquo;. Anyone who sleeps near you will be pleased to hear Go Note Go is always in focus. So it doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to announce \u0026ldquo;focused\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;focus lost\u0026rdquo; for you to know if it\u0026rsquo;s OK to type. LED status indicators are also available for you to confirm it\u0026rsquo;s working (or you can run the \u0026ldquo;:status\u0026rdquo; command to get an auditory \u0026ldquo;ok\u0026rdquo;.)\nGo Note Go integrates with external note-taking systems. I use Dropbox to store the audio clips, and Roam Research to store the notes and display the audio. This allows Go Note Go to directly contribute to my Spaced Repetition system, my notes on other projects, my notes on life, etc, and for my Go Note Go notes to be accessible anywhere, even on the go!\nGo Note Go still supports all the old capabilities of shh shell. All the old commands still work, but now they work everywhere. Entering notes by text still works, but now it\u0026rsquo;s easier to search through them and return to them later. You can still use Go Note Go as you drift off to sleep, and you can still use Go Note Go when you shower, but now you can also use it as you drive or when you camp.\nSupported Note-taking Systems Audio clips are uploaded to Dropbox.\nText notes are uploaded to Roam Research, where the audio is also embedded.\nThe system is extensible to support other storage systems and note-taking systems. I aim to have Go Note Go work with all popular note-taking systems. If you want to add a new note-taking system, get in touch.\nIssuing Commands Go Note Go comes with an extensible command system. Like with shh shell, you can issue a textual command by starting a note with a colon \u0026ldquo;:\u0026rdquo;. Examples of supported commands include setting alarms with \u0026ldquo;:at 9am : alarm\u0026rdquo;, or getting the time read aloud to you with \u0026ldquo;:time\u0026rdquo;.\nSee the shh shell write up for more on text commands.\nGo Note Go supports voice commands too. I use the keyword \u0026ldquo;go go\u0026rdquo; to issue an audio command. \u0026ldquo;go go time\u0026rdquo; will cause the system to read the time aloud. And \u0026ldquo;go go read back\u0026rdquo; will have the system read back your last typed note.\nWhy is it called Go Note Go? It\u0026rsquo;s a note-taking system for when you\u0026rsquo;re on the go. Like any good note-taking system, it can help you make decisions. This includes but is not limited to go/go-no decisions.\nGo Note Go is not implemented in Go.\nWhy note just take notes on your computer or phone, or with a voice recorder? Go Note Go is great at reducing friction. It\u0026rsquo;s really nice to not having to switch to a note-taking app. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to switch tabs or windows. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to wait for anything to load. If the keyboard is there and on, you can type on it and know your notes are being recorded (there are LED status indicators for peace of mind.)\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also of course nice not having to do any manual uploading or transcription that other approaches might require. And being integrated with your central note-taking system is a big plus over some alternate app approaches.\nSupport for extensible commands (e.g. for sending messages, reading emails, whatever\u0026hellip;) is a nice plus too.\nAnd of course my favorite feature is that there is no monitor, and so no distractions. There\u0026rsquo;s no endless scrolling on Facebook, no accidentally visiting Reddit or Twitter. Just a keyboard, a button, and your brain at peace.\nHow is Go Note Go extensible? There are two ways. You can bring your own note-taking system, and you can add arbitrary voice and textual commands to Go Note Go.\n Note-taking systems Commands  Go Note Go can support uploading notes to any note-taking system. The first system we have support for is Roam Research, but adding new ones isn\u0026rsquo;t difficult. If you want to use Go Note Go with a different note-taking system, I\u0026rsquo;d be happy to help you through the process.\nGo Note Go also supports voice and text commands. You can add your own commands as well!\nWhy need to push a button instead of a wake word? I don\u0026rsquo;t want to feel like I\u0026rsquo;m always being listened to. I also don\u0026rsquo;t want it recording conversations. I only want it to record when I tell it to, and the physical switch is quite satisfying.\n  Two points define a line, right? \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1631664000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1631664000,"objectID":"e9eae669f8137e4494103ec87012ef91","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/projects/go-note-go/","publishdate":"2021-09-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/go-note-go/","section":"projects","summary":"A note-taking system for when you’re on the go, with a focus on driving and camping.","tags":["Software","Hardware","Productivity"],"title":"Go Note Go","type":"projects"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Bieber Bot is a highly motivated robot that assists me with my financials, tweets on my behalf, and keeps me productive when my brain feels otherwise.\nIs Bieber Bot related to Justin Bieber?

I was just a small piece of this epic endeavor. Bianca was the organizer and driving force for a really impressive piece of puzzle craftsmanship.\nThe premise for the escape room is based on the webcomic Girl Genius. Here\u0026rsquo;s what you need to know:\nEscape Castle Heterodyne There\u0026rsquo;s a castle, Castle Heterodyne, which is a living, breathing, talking entity. In our escape room, the Castle is voiced by Mark Velednitsky. The castle\u0026rsquo;s personality is damaged, and you and your team (4 people total) have been sent into the castle to see if you can repair it. The castle, in it\u0026rsquo;s damaged state, doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand that you\u0026rsquo;re here to help. Quite the opposite in fact; it considers you hostile! At your entrance, Castle Heterodyne slams its doors shut behind you. It cuts power to the lights and activates its 30 minute self-destruct countdown.\nCan you repair the castle, thereby bringing it back to its senses? Can you escape your impending doom? You must solve puzzles and make your way through four decorative challenge-filled rooms if you wish to live to see another day.\nThe Engine Room I was responsible for just the first room of the escape room (as well as, I later learned, anything requiring height). This first room was the Engine Room. When you enter the Engine Room, der Castle promptly kills the lights and initiates the castle\u0026rsquo;s self-destruct sequence.\nYour challenge: get the lights up and running again.\nYou do this by first locating a blacklight flashlight on the table in the room. You use this blacklight flashlight to read clues written in invisible ink on colored paper hidden around the room. These clues in turn allow you to figure out which of the nearly 50 switches you need to flip in order to turn all the lights on without overheating any of them.\nThis is what the puzzle looks like partial solved:\nWhile the physical puzzle is no longer operational, you can have a go at the software-only version of the puzzle:  Click here to try the puzzle.\nStorage Closet Once you successfully turn the lights back on in the Engine Room, the castle realizes your utility, and presents you with the key to the next room: the Storage Closet. It\u0026rsquo;s too late to turn off the self-destruct sequence though, and so your only way out is forward, through the Storage Closet and the rest of the castle.\nThe Storage Closet is in my opinion the coolest room in the Castle. I will refrain from spoiling it here (for now), and simply tell you that I was very impressed with the work that went into it.\nEscaping the Castle Making your way through the Storage Closet, you must next navigate the Secret Lab, the Pink Torture Chamber (no puzzles here), and lastly the Crypt. Only after solving the puzzles in each of these rooms with the help can you escape der Castle and avoid a ghastly death.\nThe source code for the Engine Room puzzle (both the physical version and the software-only version) is available on GitHub here.\n","date":1509148800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509148800,"objectID":"bd73a111fb3ddd139ca715edcb8d5a9e","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/projects/escape-castle-heterodyne/","publishdate":"2017-10-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/escape-castle-heterodyne/","section":"projects","summary":"We built an escape room!","tags":["Hardware","Just for Fun","Puzzle"],"title":"Escape Castle Heterodyne","type":"projects"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Python Fire is a Python library for automatically creating command line interfaces (CLIs) from absolutely any Python object.\nCheck it out at https://github.com/google/python-fire.\nI originally wrote Python Fire after joining Google Brain in 2016.

It is designed to minimize the mental energy required for use, to avoid disturbing your attempt at sleep as much as possible.\nWhy is it called shh shell? It\u0026rsquo;s a play on \u0026ldquo;ssh\u0026rdquo;, a common unix utility that stands for \u0026ldquo;secure shell\u0026rdquo;. shh (prounced in a whisper, \u0026ldquo;shhh\u0026hellip;\u0026quot;) is a quiet shell that takes minimal mental energy to use, great for use while you\u0026rsquo;re drifting off to sleep.\nWhat can the shh shell do? My primary use of the shh shell is leaving notes for myself. I also use shh to set peaceful YouTube music alarms for myself, and to check the time without needing to open my eyes.\nHere is the full list (as of 2015-11-28) of my uses of shh shell, past and present:\n Leaving notes for myself for the morning Checking the time Playing YouTube videos (I only hear the audio, of course) Google searching and opening webpages Setting alarms (usually in the form of songs on YouTube) Checking my email Sending emails Sending iMessages Scheduling emails or messages to send in the future Making TODOs for myself Setting goals for the future Performing calculations Practicing relative pitch Recording audio memos of myself for later Executing arbitrary shell commands  The current list of shh commands is available here.\nOf course, not all of these have proven to be useful features. The most useful features for me have been the ability to leave notes for myself for the morning, the ability to check the time without opening my eyes, and the ability to set alarms and listen to music via the shell. The audio memo feature has been occasionally useful too.\nAt no point did I find the ability to check my email via the shh shell useful.\nI did temporarily get good at recognizing pitch intervals, but I have not sustained that ability.\nIs this a replacement for shells like Bash, zsh, and Fish? No, this is not meant as a full replacement for Bash, zsh, Fish, etc.\nThat said, it does support arbitrary command execution though, via the shell command. That means typing :shell rm -f important_file will cause important_file to be removed. So, you have to make sure you\u0026rsquo;re not a self-sabotaging hacker in your sleep before you start using shh as your night time shell.\nYou can additionally add arbitrary new commands by editing the file shh_commands.py.\nWhere do you use the shh shell? I use the shh shell by keeping a wireless keyboard in my bed. It is connected to my laptop, which I leave open but with the monitor turned fully off.\nThis means I\u0026rsquo;m not at risk of damaging my computer by rolling over on it or drooling on it :).\nI leave the volume on my laptop on, so I can hear the shh shell\u0026rsquo;s output, but I never need to open my eyes to use it.\nCan you use it in the shower? Yes, I sometimes also use shh shell from the shower. I have a waterproof wireless keyboard in my shower. I am mildly embarassed by this.\nThe keyboard is connected wirelessly to my laptop running the shh shell in another room. There is no computer in the bathroom. For audio, I have a waterproof shower speaker connected via bluetooth to the laptop in the other room. The speaker sits in the shower next to the keyboard, which both rest on a ledge. There is a 3D-printed shaving cream holder nearby.\nI know, I hear myself too.\nUsing the shh shell When you open the shh shell on your computer, you get a small black window into which you can type large white text. When you\u0026rsquo;re new to the shell, it can be useful to look at this window to see what you\u0026rsquo;re typing. As you become more experienced with the shh shell, you can turn your monitor off and close your eyes, relying only on the auditory feedback the shell provides.\nGetting in Focus When you type, it\u0026rsquo;s important that you\u0026rsquo;re typing in the shell. If you\u0026rsquo;re not in the shell, you might be typing in another application on your computer or you might not be typing in an application at all.\nTo assist with this, the shell will audibly say \u0026ldquo;focused\u0026rdquo; when the shell becomes your selected application, and \u0026ldquo;focus lost\u0026rdquo; when the shell loses focus. If the shh shell is not in focus, or if you\u0026rsquo;re not sure if the shell is in focus, then use \u0026ldquo;cmd-TAB\u0026rdquo; to switch applications until you hear the shell announce \u0026ldquo;focused\u0026rdquo;. Once you hear this sound, you can safely type knowing that the shell is receiving your input.\nLeaving Notes for Yourself The default mode of the shell is to act as a notepad and keylogger. Every letter typed and every key pressed is logged with a timestamp when you are in the shh shell. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, this data is only saved locally and keys aren\u0026rsquo;t logged when you\u0026rsquo;re in other applications, so it\u0026rsquo;s not going to steal your credentials for other apps.\nOnly if you start a line with : does shh interpret the line as a command. So, its unlikely you\u0026rsquo;ll accidentally run commands you don\u0026rsquo;t intend to if you roll over your keyboard while sleeping.\nEverything you type will be there waiting for you in the morning, so leave yourself notes, dream diaries, action items, whatever it is that you need to get out of your head so late at night.\nEven if you accidentally fall asleep on the delete key, thereby deleting everything you typed (ahh!), in the morning you will still be able to view the notes you typed since every character is logged.\nRunning Commands To run a command, start a new line with a colon (:) followed by the command name, and then the command arguments.\nFor example, type :help in the shh shell to get a full list of supported commands.\nSome of my favorite commands are time, m (short for music), say, and at.\nHere are some of the commands I\u0026rsquo;ll type frequently:\n :time  This will cause the shell to read the date and time aloud.   :m billy joel  This will immediately cause some Billy Joel music from YouTube to start playing. Most songs and artists should work.   :at 9:30am :m billy joel  This will set an alarm for 9:30am the following morning. At that time, it will execute the command m billy joel, which will cause some Billy Joel music from YouTube to start playing. What a nice way to wake up! The shell is forgiving about small changes to syntax such as added spaces, so don\u0026rsquo;t worry about getting the commands exactly right.   :say hi  I use this as a test that my hands are aligned properly with the keyboard. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t say \u0026ldquo;hi\u0026rdquo;, that probably means my hands are offset from the keys and I typed a bit of gibberish. The command :status serves the same purpose, but just says \u0026ldquo;ok\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;hi\u0026rdquo;.    Using the \u0026ldquo;at\u0026rdquo; command The \u0026ldquo;at\u0026rdquo; command is useful because it allows you to simply schedule other commands to run at a designated time in the future.\nTo use the at command, type :at \u0026lt;when\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;command\u0026gt;. It\u0026rsquo;s OK if \u0026lt;when\u0026gt; has a colon in the middle, e.g. \u0026lt;when\u0026gt; could be 7:30am. It could also be tomorrow at 9am \u0026ndash; the syntax for \u0026lt;when\u0026gt; is flexible. \u0026lt;command\u0026gt; can be any of the commands shh supports, such as alarm for playing music from youtube. E.g. :at 7:30am : alarm would schedule a musical alarm for 7:30am the following day.\nAdding new commands You can easily add new commands by adding new functions to shh_commands.py.\nSimply add a function decorated with the @command decorator to add a new command to your shh shell. If your command accepts arguments, include {} in the format string for your command, and the user\u0026rsquo;s arguments will be passed to your function when the command is run.\nTroubleshooting One common mistake is to start typing a command in the middle of a line. When in doubt about whether you are at the start of a line, just hit enter. You cannot go by the visual representation in the black box \u0026ndash; all that is is a text field, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily represent the internal state of your shell. So, just hit enter, then type your command, beginning with a colon.\nThere is no concept of a cursor in shh. The arrow keys don\u0026rsquo;t do anything. So even if the cursor in the text box appears to be in the middle of a line, in practice you are always typing at the end of the current content and the logged text will reflect this.\nFor additional issues, please open an Issue on GitHub.\nInstalling the Shh Shell Head on over to https://github.com/dbieber/shh-shell for instructions on how to set up the shh shell.\nA bit of backstory Why did you create a non-visual shell? There was a time during undergrad when I was losing sleep to thoughts swirling around in my head. \u0026ldquo;Does she like me?\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;I should have responded in this slightly different way,\u0026rdquo; etc. Variations on a theme would rattle around in my head, each variation only slightly different from thoughts I had already thought. How could I make them stop?\nI found that writing down my thoughts helped stop this rattling. Once a single canonical representation of the thought was written on paper, that was sufficient for my brain. It stopped feeling the need to iterate on the thought, and it let me get to sleep.\nHowever, writing on paper in the dark meant that in the morning, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t easily read what I had written. My handwriting at night was slanted and somewhat illegible.\nI tried turning the lights on to write down my thoughts, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t like how that woke me up. I tried notepad apps on my phone for writing down my thoughts, but my phone is bright and this was not much better than turning the lights on and using paper.\nSo, I started typing on my computer with the monitor off. This was a great solution, but it came with it\u0026rsquo;s own problem: I needed to know if I was typing in the right window. Hence, shh shell was born. The gradual addition of commands over time has an added bonus that makes shh shell even more useful for me.\nIsn\u0026rsquo;t the audio annoying to anyone else trying to sleep? Yes, my college roommate Harvest can attest to the annoyance of hearing repeated \u0026ldquo;focused\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;focus lost\u0026rdquo; throughout the night.\nI cannot in good conscience recommend use of shh shell when sleeping with your significant other.\nWhat have you typed into your shh shell? When I first started typing at night back in 2014, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t used to typing without visual feedback. So in the morning when I went to look at what I had typed, I was surprised to find a large paragraph of complete gibberish! My hands had been offset by a key or so on the keyboard as I was typing. To me, it looked like a cryptographic code. Only the final line of the text was readable: \u0026ldquo;I hope the FBI doesn\u0026rsquo;t find out about this.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat made this particularly cool for me was that I had no recollection of what I had typed the night before. What was I concerned about the FBI finding out!?\nDecoding the paragrah wasn\u0026rsquo;t too challenging, since each letter was just off by one or so on the keyboard, and so I was soon able to figure out what I had typed. It was an amazing experience decoding this, because as I did so, my memory came back. The text was a description of a dream that I had woken up from and typed into shh before falling back asleep. I was not involved in any criminal activity :).\nBefore I decoded the mysterious paragraph, I had forgotten entirely about the dream. As I decoded though, I remembered the dream, waking from it, and writing down what had happened.\nSince then, I\u0026rsquo;ve now gotten used to typing in the dark and using the little bumps on the F and J keys to guide my hands. So, I don\u0026rsquo;t have to decode mysterious passages about hiding secrets from the FBI anymore. I have now repeatedly experienced not remembering having typed something until I see what I typed in the morning, and each time the memory of typing it comes back as I read what I wrote. This hasn\u0026rsquo;t ceased to be a very cool feeling each time it occurs.\nConclusion While I built this for myself, I have made it open source in the hope that you too may benefit from it. I hope it helps someone out there get a better night\u0026rsquo;s sleep or remember a key idea they would have forgotten. Definitely check out the shh shell on GitHub and give it a try if you\u0026rsquo;re Python-inclined. And as always, feel free to get in touch if you want to discuss this project or anything else.\n","date":1407024000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1407024000,"objectID":"282066a74a91073b2f9e2a45bca88f7d","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/projects/shh-shell/","publishdate":"2014-08-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/shh-shell/","section":"projects","summary":"The soothing shell for while you sleep.","tags":["Software","Productivity"],"title":"shh Shell","type":"projects"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Scrabble Bot loves Scrabble and social media!

So, I haven\u0026rsquo;t eliminated mindless scrolling altogether. My phone usage has decreased considerably overall though.\nThe oddest thing about it is that I don\u0026rsquo;t always have a way of knowing the itme when I wake up. I may want to put a non-phone clock in the bedroom to compensate for this.\nSometimes over the last six months I would find I accidentally would bring my phone with me to my desk. Usually this would happen after going out of the house for lunch (taking my phone with me). When I would return to the house, I would have my phone in my pocket, and I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t always remember to put it in the kitchen. Once the phone reached my desk, sometimes I would then inadvertently scroll! Whenever I notice that I\u0026rsquo;ve brought my phone somewhere in the house outside the kitchen, it\u0026rsquo;s clear the right thing for me to do under this silly system I\u0026rsquo;ve chosen for myself, is to bring it back to the kitchen.\nIt can be tempting to make only small violations to the rule, but I\u0026rsquo;ve realized it\u0026rsquo;s best not to fall for such temptations. There\u0026rsquo;s a bathroom just outside the kitchen, and I am tempted often to take the phone with me from the kitchen to the bathroom. I stop at the threshold to the kitchen, and do not cross if I\u0026rsquo;m holding my phone. Perhaps I stand in the threshold for a few minutes, finishing my phone usage before leaving. I put the phone down before exiting.\nIf I were to take the phone to the bathroom, I know what would happen. I would think, going in, that I will just use the phone for one particular purpose. However, as soon as I turn the screen on I would notice something that would put a different purpose into my mind. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s a text message, or an app icon, or a notification. I think, switching tasks, that it\u0026rsquo;s a small diversion and I will momentarily return to the original purpose. However, moments later while completing the secondary task, my mental stack will erode, and the primary task will no longer be at the forefront of my brain. I\u0026rsquo;ll no longer be thinking about the one-and-done approach to phone usage, and now the potential for mindless scrolling has emerged.\nSo, the phone stays in the kitchen.

The Codex model is made deterministic, such that rerunning the model on the prompts always produces the same source code. The user can make further modifications to the source code that the model produces. The result is two parallel streams of text: (1) the natural language, and (2) the final source code. These parallel streams can be saved in version control, shared, modified, remixed, and run.\nA non-programmer might still be able to make modifications, simply by modifying the natural language text, without making modifications to the source code at all. This could be a way to learn a bit about programming for the curious non-programmer too, as they can observe the changes to the source code that result from changing the natural language text.\nIt is tempting to think that only the diff between the source code produced by the model and the final source code need be stored. However, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t hold up. The prompt when generating source code includes all earlier source code in the file.

Take everything here with a grain of salt.\nToday, we can perform germline gene editing somewhat reliably. It\u0026rsquo;s been done on human beings; the scientist who performed this first, I believe has gone to jail for the ethics violations involved in doing so. Our interest in this snippet, however, doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the full set of ethical qualms that applying gene editing to humans has. We\u0026rsquo;re interested in applying gene editing to plants.\nGMOs aren\u0026rsquo;t knew, but they\u0026rsquo;re (at least in the big picture) in their infancy. Today, particular seeds have been patented, leading to monopolistic anti-competitive practices by, for example, Monsanto. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be the way gene-editing looks in the future. There\u0026rsquo;s a chance it\u0026rsquo;s more widely accessible and commonly used in ordinary people\u0026rsquo;s homes in the future. Not just through people purchasing GMO seeds (already modified) from a store and planting them, but rather by modifying the genome of a seed in their own home and then planting it in their own garden.\nIn a very hand-wavy sort of way, here\u0026rsquo;s a bit of what this future history looks like.\n COVID makes in-home PCR more affordable more common. Since there\u0026rsquo;s demand for in-home viral testing, the components and skills involved in bioengineering start becoming more commonplace. This is already happening. Our understanding of the genome is increasing every week. This is already happening. People will be able to modify the genome of plants using a library of known edits. E.g. take the basil genome, replace GAAT at positive 1004 with TAAG, and you\u0026rsquo;ll get freeze-resistant basil. Eventually people will be able to use software to create genomes using higher-level constructs than directly writing the base-pairs in the desired DNS. First this will mean listing out proteins instead of individual base-pairs. Later it will involve listing out multi-protein mechanisms, or higher level traits. Eventually it will shift from being \u0026ldquo;like programming\u0026rdquo; to a no-code process, where even children will be able to design plants. They\u0026rsquo;ll sketch the desired leaf shapes, choose the yummiest flavor profiles, select the environment in which the plant should thrive, etc.  The advantages of CRISPR gardening over traditional gardening include:\n  You can customize plants that are tailor made for your diet\n  \u0026hellip; for your climate\n  \u0026hellip; for your aesthetic\n  \u0026hellip; to express your creativity\n  You can easily share a custom genome on the internet. Sharing the diff from a known genome takes less bandwidth, but even sharing a full genome is easy. This is far easier and more scalable than sharing physical seeds.\n  In order to get to this point, it would be useful to have \u0026ldquo;factories\u0026rdquo; / robot-biotech-gardens systematically mutating plant genomes, growing the resultant plants in various ways, and recording the effects. The individual components of this vision are already underway. Companies like IronOx use robots to grow vegetables in warehouses without human intervention. Other companies provide robot-performanced wetlab experiments. Now what we need is to bring these players together, so that we can most efficiently more toward fully understanding plant genomes and the CRISPR gardening era that awaits.\nOne day, when I have my own house and CRISPR garden, I\u0026rsquo;m going to have garden gnomes \u0026ndash; or g-gnomes for short.\n","date":1628467200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628467200,"objectID":"fa4e71956666ddb9e41ba082415c8f31","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-08-09-crispr-gardening/","publishdate":"2021-08-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2021-08-09-crispr-gardening/","section":"snippets","summary":"Everyone likes their veggies crisp, so who wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want CRISPR veggies?

Mine ends across my chest on the left side of my body. When I try to end my forehand by my forehead, I mess it up terribly. Until now.\n Two weeks ago I came up with the following reasons / hypotheses for why a good stroke would end at the forehand. They were:\n Lower to the table is better Each stroke should prepare for the next stroke Don\u0026rsquo;t cut the stroke short Balance many concerns (1, 2, 3, hitting up and forward through the path of the ball, hitting toward the target, keeping balance, preparing for next stroke)  These are all valid reasons, but they didn\u0026rsquo;t do it for me. Then, on Tuesday (two days ago), it clicked. If I focus on hitting forward, the stroke comes out much better.\nThis is a bit counterintuitive since my forehead is up and right, not forward, relative to where my stroke used to end. Still, by focusing on hitting more forward, it seems I cannot cut the stroke short and I don\u0026rsquo;t move as much to the left. This should reduce side spin, maybe increase top spin, and definitely increase power on my strokes.\nNow, I\u0026rsquo;ve only had the opportunity to play a small amount since making this realization. It\u0026rsquo;s still going to take lots of practice to incorporate this more fully into my game. It feels good though, the strokes are strong and natural. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel rote, but it does feel mostly intuitive, which is a good place to start from. Contrast this with when I was trying to land the stroke at my forehead. For those attempts, the stroke felt unnatural and I would usually miss.\nLooking forward to drilling my new stroke extensively tonight.\n","date":1626912000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1626912000,"objectID":"17a67b1c4dc3c90f304e0d3d61e0d4bd","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-07-22-forehead-is-forward/","publishdate":"2021-07-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2021-07-22-forehead-is-forward/","section":"snippets","summary":"It makes sense now!

The full stroke is a bit like this:\n Stance   The ball is coming toward your forehand side; get in position early. Your body is angled slightly to the right, e.g. forming a 15 degree angle between the back edge of the table and the line through your shoulders. Your elbow is bent at 90 degree. Your wrist is straight, so the paddle forms an extension of the arm. Your knees are bent, butt out. You\u0026rsquo;re low to the table, at my height almost squatting.  Ball incoming   As the ball approaches there\u0026rsquo;s a small setup phase, where you take the paddle back, and twist to your right a little to allow for a more explosive shot.  Stroke   Soon after the ball bounces, say at the peak of the bounce or earlier, you move the paddle through the path of the ball toward where you want to take the ball. Your torso rotates the same direction as your arm and paddle. The three have very little relative motion. Your weight shifts forward at the same time. You can accelerate your paddle during contact with the ball for a more powerful shot.  Follow through   As you follow through the ball, your racket moves near your forehead.  When I, a new player, take a forehand shot, my racket often lands near my chest, not my forehead. This feels more natural. Why is it better to move near the forehead than the chest, and how do you achieve this?\nReason 1: Lower to the table is better It\u0026rsquo;s better to be low to the table. Being low to the table lets you see the spin better, and gives more arm and leg mobility. It takes more energy though, being in a squat position. Too low, and the mobility decreases. When you\u0026rsquo;re higher, the follow through to a forehand is more likely to land at your chest, whereas when you\u0026rsquo;re lower, it\u0026rsquo;s going to naturally be closer to your forehead.\nReason 2: Each stroke should prepare for the next stroke A mistake I make is to take a stroke and then bring the paddle back along roughly the same path of the stroke in reverse. Instead, it is faster to make strokes in a circular pattern. Hit through the ball, and continue hitting in an egg-shape pattern until your paddle is back where it started ready for the next stroke. This reduces the need to decelerate the paddle and re-accelerate in the opposite direction. On the other hand, when this isn\u0026rsquo;t practiced so that it\u0026rsquo;s second nature, this consumes extra concentration.\nThe forehead might be a natural place on the path toward setting up the next stroke. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure about this one. To me, the chest seems just as viable.\nReason 3: Don\u0026rsquo;t cut the stroke short To get maximum power and control, you want to hit the ball toward a particular spot on the table. You want to follow through toward that spot, so that you\u0026rsquo;re hitting in the desired direction for the entire contact with the ball. If you cut the stroke short, aka \u0026ldquo;shorting the stroke\u0026rdquo;, you\u0026rsquo;ll impart some side-spin on the ball but won\u0026rsquo;t get maximum power or control. I guess it works out that moving from the stroke earlier shorts the stroke and ends with the paddle at chest height, but doing a full stroke ends with the paddle at forehead height. This is because the forehand should be moving forward and up through the path of the ball, and a longer time moving up takes you closer to forehead height.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t want to move too far forward and up though. That would leave you with the paddle over the table and your elbow extended, unprepared for the next shot.\nReason 4: Balance many concerns Ultimately we want to balance all of these concerns:\n Staying low to the table Hitting up and forward through the path of the ball Hitting toward the target location Keeping our balance Preparing early for the next shot  Collectively, this leads to the classic table tennis shot, landing with a forehead height follow through and quick recovery.\n","date":1625875200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625875200,"objectID":"ef7e0d6abbcc70b7cda8a1f52095212c","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-07-10-forehand-to-forehead/","publishdate":"2021-07-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2021-07-10-forehand-to-forehead/","section":"snippets","summary":"In a table tennis forehand, the stroke typically ends at the forehead.

In a recently released batch of drills, he took a point played by table tennis pro Mima Ito and reconstructed it in VR. The ball machine would \u0026ndash; endlessly in a loop \u0026ndash; play the role of Mima Ito\u0026rsquo;s opponent. It would launch ping pong balls from the same location and with the same trajectory that Mima Ito\u0026rsquo;s opponent hit the ball during the point.\nThe reconstruction is a great experience; it really demonstrates the level of play, showcasing how fast and wide the ball goes during professional matches. It also highlights the potential of Eleven Table Tennis as a practice tool for real table tennis. You can reconstruct points from your own real-life table tennis matches in virtual reality, and practice them as many times as you like.\nToday, the process of reconstructing a point from real life in VR is a bit slow and specialized. The way to do it is to open Eleven Table Tennis on a PC (which I don\u0026rsquo;t currently have, making this difficult), and to adjust the ball machine settings on your computer in order to replicate each of your opponent\u0026rsquo;s ball trajectories consecutively. Once a full point is done, you can play against the ball machine in VR to practice.\nAt my last table tennis tournament, I took some footage of myself playing (and losing) a real table tennis match. I haven\u0026rsquo;t yet tried transcribing it to VR, in part because I don\u0026rsquo;t have a PC. Soon though I hope to transcribe some points so I can practice the shots I\u0026rsquo;m weakest against.\nI estimate that reconstructing a single shot, once you\u0026rsquo;re practiced in the art of table tennis point transcription, takes about a minute. This means that transcribing a full 5-game match, which might have as many as 300-500 individual shots, could take 5-8 hours.\nThere are several ways to bring this time down. First, and simplest, is to merely transcribe a subset of the points. Only transcribing shots by your opponent immediately cuts the time in half, and you probably only will want to replay perhaps 10 points total anyway, further cutting down the reconstruction time drastically. Outsourcing the reconstruction to e.g. Fiverr seems plausible, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t save time overall, it merely pushes the time cost onto someone else.\nPerhaps there\u0026rsquo;s a way to automate the transcription process. Stupa Analytics uses AI to analyze table tennis matches to provide coaching to players. It seems likely that they model the trajectory of table tennis balls as part of this analysis. Their software works using video from a single phone camera, which is ideal if it works. Perhaps we can build on top of their existing vision systems. I\u0026rsquo;ve reached out to them to inquire, but have not heard back. I\u0026rsquo;ve also tried to use their software, which promised me analysis within 72 hours, but a week later it has still not delivered.\nSome projects on GitHub also show promise for enabling automated transcription. ckjellson/tt_tracker uses OpenCV to track table tennis balls using two camera inputs. vmarquet/table-tennis-computer-vision also offers ball tracking for table tennis using OpenCV, though may require specialized sensors (not clear yet). maudzung/TTNet-Real-time-Analysis-System-for-Table-Tennis-Pytorch uses machine learning to analyze table tennis footage, including ball tracking. These three seem the most promising. Though I don\u0026rsquo;t have any two camera input data currently, I look forward to trying out these projects and seeing if I can repurpose one for RL-to-VR point reconstruction.\n","date":1625270400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625270400,"objectID":"5656da0b88d83853c154469697a8febe","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-07-03-reconstructing-rl-tt-in-vr/","publishdate":"2021-07-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2021-07-03-reconstructing-rl-tt-in-vr/","section":"snippets","summary":"\u0026ldquo;Alex TT Barcelona\u0026rdquo; makes table tennis drills for Eleven Table Tennis.

The Magnus effect cause the trajectory to bend in the direction that leading edge of the ball is traveling in.\nThis is why topspin balls fall faster and backspin balls float. When you hit a topspin ball, the leading part of the ball (furthest from you) is moving down. In a backspin shot the leading part of the ball is moving up.\nWhen the side-spin ball bounces on the table, it can bounce to the left. When it bounces off your racket, however, it will move to the right. The same spin that\u0026rsquo;s left-spin when coming toward you is right-spin when moving away from you. It isn\u0026rsquo;t that the spin reversed. The spin stayed the same; just the ball\u0026rsquo;s direction reversed. The leading edge is now the one furthest from you. The part of the ball that contacted the paddle was moving left, so it pushed the paddle left and itself right. Now as it moves away it has right-spin on it and the leading edge of the ball in its new trajectory is moving to the right.\nThis suggests a difficult but powerful attack. Send a fast left-spin ball (by moving your paddle to the right) down the right side of the table. When your opponent goes to return it, the default behavior will be for it to bounce to your right, their left, further off the right edge of the table.\n","date":1624237200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1624237200,"objectID":"c3af4fe511fbba0a0aa9bcd2e3a14225","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-06-21-responding-to-side-spin/","publishdate":"2021-06-21T01:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2021-06-21-responding-to-side-spin/","section":"snippets","summary":"If the server moves their paddle from your left top right across the ball, then add the ball cones toward you its trajectory will bend to your left.

The backhand push typically imparts backspin.\nThe drive is more of a forward motion, giving a flatter resulting ball compared with the heavier topspin of a flick or loop. A backhand drive done well might result in a flat ball entirely, rather than a topspin one.\nThe backhand flick and loop might actually refer to the same stroke, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. I\u0026rsquo;ll say what I think the differences are. The backhand flick uses very heavy wrist to get topspin, while the loop drives is topspin more from forward motion of the paddle, both brushing the top of the ball to import heavy topspin.\nIn both cases (in all cases, really) it\u0026rsquo;s important to keep the wrist (and shoulder) relaxed, forming up most (but only a little) at the time of making contact with the ball. Remaining relaxed allows you to adjust strokes more quickly. This allows handling unexpected ball placements and decisions from the expected spin and bounce more gracefully.\nClassical advice suggests you should not reach (extending your elbow) so that you can always use the same shot, and so you have more control over the angle of your paddle. Instead of reaching, the advice goes, you should move your feet so you\u0026rsquo;re in position to hit the ball. This advice can be misleading; it\u0026rsquo;s silly to avoid reaching when reaching is necessary, and it\u0026rsquo;s bad advice to avoid learning a useful stroke. It\u0026rsquo;s good advice to use your feet. And above all, it\u0026rsquo;s a good observation that reaching can be a common failure mode for the backhand strokes.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also true that when this failure mode arises it can be naturally accompanied by pointing the racket face in slightly the wrong direction.\nThe primary ways to counter this are:\n practicing footwork to get into place experience so if you have to reach you get the angle right awareness of the pitfall so you can notice it and adjust more rapidly  A bad thing to do would be to avoid reaching when reaching is necessary.\nAnother piece of advice is to avoid reaching forward. This advice is similar to that above about reaching left on backhands. You can put your leg under the table to minimize your reach, but ultimately reaching is necessary for retrieving drop shots and other short shots. The right takeaway is that footwork comes first, not that racing should be avoided.\nIt often gets repeated that the reason to avoid reaching is so you can reuse your strokes. This seems like you\u0026rsquo;re setting yourself up for failure. To succeed in unexpected situations you need to know exactly how your paddle behaves no matter how you\u0026rsquo;re hitting it. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to just be memorizing a small number of strokes and applying them as best as possible in whatever situation arises. If you do that, your game-play will be so fragile. It won\u0026rsquo;t work if the ball\u0026rsquo;s a little too high, too low, or too wide. Better to practice both the core strokes, the necessary footwork, AND how to use your strokes at their extreme values for when footwork and reflexes are insufficient to bring the ball into a standard position.

Use shoulder, wrist, and a little torso, I think in that order. A basic shot would be mostly shoulder. For a more attacking show, a proper flick, add in a lot of wrist. Finally for max power, add a tiny bit of torso. And you should use leg power too. Left foot beyond the edge of the table, closer to the table than the right foot Relaxed wrist Watch the ball all the way in Hit the top of the ball, say 2/3 of the way up Practice! Have a plan when starting the point. Always be ready to third ball attack when serving.  How about tips for the forehand drive?\n Move early into position Again the goal is to use the same stroke each time As before shoulder, wrist, and torso are key. Wow, despite looking so different the tips are remarkably similar to the backhand flick Watch the ball all the way in Brush up the ball Your stroke ends in front of your face And your wrist points forward from your forearm, not up And I think the squat is perhaps a bit reduced compared with the backhand flick  ","date":1623895200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1623895200,"objectID":"d98d5942a6d6079f9aba603dffcacd7c","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-06-17-areas-of-table-tennis-to-improve-at/","publishdate":"2021-06-17T02:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2021-06-17-areas-of-table-tennis-to-improve-at/","section":"snippets","summary":"Right now the biggest area to work on is having the confidence (and skill) to attack in a match setting.\nI have this confidence in Eleven Table Tennis (ETT), usually, but in the real world its harder to demonstrate.

Just get words on paper and get going.\nThis is a snippet about writing in the woods. I haven\u0026rsquo;t solved it. I\u0026rsquo;ll start by explaining some of the problems that come up when you (I) set out to write in the woods. They aren\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;problems\u0026rdquo; so much as ideas for quality of life improvements, but again, the word choice isn\u0026rsquo;t important.\nQOL Idea 1: A surface for the keyboard When I find a nice place to sit \u0026ndash; one that won\u0026rsquo;t leave my butt wet, overly dirty, or otherwise too uncomfortable \u0026ndash; there is rarely a clear place for my keyboard. (\u0026ldquo;rarely\u0026rdquo; == \u0026ldquo;If there\u0026rsquo;s a picnic table, then there is, but otherwise there is not.\u0026quot;) Most often the seat I find is a stone or a tree trunk, and the most natural places to put the keyboard are: (1) on my lap, or (2) to my side, on the trunk or stone.\nThese methods work. I can write. I enjoy it immensely. However, neither is ideal. One leaves the keyboard unsteady and thereby slows typing, the other cranes my neck. Perhaps bringing a board to place on my lap could solve the problem. I know lap desks are a thing; I don\u0026rsquo;t know if they pack well for hiking. I don\u0026rsquo;t need something the full size of a lap desk though; a simple 4\u0026rdquo; x 12\u0026quot; stiff piece of material would likely be sufficient to provide the keyboard some rigidity. The keyboard I use folds in half, and can buckle in the middle while I type if not on a surface that supports it. Alternatively to the stiff material, I could find a keyboard that doesn\u0026rsquo;t have this buckling issue. It would be larger than the current keyboard, but not larger than the keyboard plus stiff material. Perhaps something like this. It\u0026rsquo;s larger than my current foldable keyboard but shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have the buckling issue, and so may do well just placed in my lap.\nAnother advantage of my current keyboard is the case doubles as a stand for my phone, so I can see what I\u0026rsquo;m typing. I don\u0026rsquo;t strictly need to see what I\u0026rsquo;m typing as I type it, but occasionally it is useful and I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to give that up unless it really enhanced the convenience of the setup.\nQOL Idea 2: More seat selection As I\u0026rsquo;m wandering in the woods I sometimes go quite a while before finding a place that looks like a good seat. As I\u0026rsquo;ve become more familiar with Guilford\u0026rsquo;s Westwoods, I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed decent tree trunks and stones more often. Sometimes they\u0026rsquo;re covered in brush though. It would be nice to be able to find a seat somewhat quickly once I reach a nice part of the woods.\nI could bring something with me to sit on. One crazy idea is those SkyMall leg-chairs \u0026ndash; a pair of legs that you wear so you can sit down anywhere\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m not going to do that; it looks uncomfortable and expensive. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking more along the lines of bringing a waterproof cushion or piece of fabric I can sit, or something to dry wet surfaces. Maybe I should just bring a trash bag to sit on. That would be easy to carry, I can sit on it to make any surface clean, and then after it even doubles as a trash bag.\nOther QOL Ideas  How can I minimize bug nuisances? A: Bug spray\u0026hellip; Can I carry water while keeping my hands free? A: Yes, with a Camelbak.

How am I going to extract this data in the flow? (2) Some games have three rounds others have two, and the css selectors differ depending on which game we\u0026rsquo;re looking at.\nChallenge 1: Stable CSS Selectors Across Page Loads Browserflow\u0026rsquo;s default CSS selector for the ELO rate on my Eleven TT page is div:nth-of-type(1) \u0026gt; .jss87 \u0026gt; .MuiTypography-root. The trouble with this is that the class .jss87 isn\u0026rsquo;t always there. Sometimes when I load the page, the class .jss70 is there instead. I don\u0026rsquo;t know how this class is determined, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t stable enough to use for my flow.\nWith a bit of poking around, I was able to use an nth-child rule to write a more stable selector. Here\u0026rsquo;s what I came up with: div.MuiGrid-container \u0026gt; .MuiPaper-root:nth-child(1) .MuiTypography-root.\nWith this new strategy in place, I can easily complete the first half of the flow (which I\u0026rsquo;ll probably actually split into two flows): regularly logging my Eleven Elo, Rank, Win and Loss count, and Win rate into a spreadsheet automatically.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what the completed flow looks like:\nChallenge 2: Varying CSS Selectors Across Rows Next up I have the challenge of selecting game data from the same page. Browserflow makes it easy to loop over the match data with its Loop Elements command. The trouble is that some matches have three rounds while others have just two.\nThe default CSS selects for the game data are e.g. $match tr:nth-of-type(1) \u0026gt; td:nth-of-type(3) for the Match Score. Two of the columns: \u0026ldquo;ELO +-\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Round 3\u0026rdquo; only show up in certain matches. \u0026ldquo;ELO +-\u0026rdquo; only shows up for ranked matches, and \u0026ldquo;Round 3\u0026rdquo; only shows up if the first two matches are split between the players.\nI expect that in rare cases there are matches with only 1 round (e.g. because a player leaves early), and that in the future there might be matches with additional rounds too.\nThe \u0026lt;td\u0026gt; elements themselves don\u0026rsquo;t contain any additional information indicating what column they belong to. I might have to take this slightly painstaking approach:\nFirst, I\u0026rsquo;ll use Get Element Text to get the text of the first six column headers, and I\u0026rsquo;ll have it use blank text if there are fewer than six headers. In some cases these will be USERNAME, ELO +-, MATCH SCORE, ROUND 1, ROUND 2, ROUND 3. In other cases it will just be a subset of this information.\nThen, for each player I\u0026rsquo;ll get the first six entries in their row. I\u0026rsquo;ll use the headers to determine what these entries describe.\nBrief programming interlude\nI\u0026rsquo;ve done it. Here\u0026rsquo;s the completed flow. It works like a charm.\nI had to make 19 Get Element Text actions and a Run Script, even though I only needed data from 13 different elements. Collecting tabular data is a pretty common task, so there\u0026rsquo;s room to make this simpler for future flows.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the script I ended up writing for populating fields based on the header data, just for reference:\nlet $player1 = $row1field1; let $player2 = $row2field1; let $elo1 = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;; let $elo2 = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;; let $elo1change = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;; let $elo2change = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;; let score_index = 1; if ($header2 == \u0026quot;ELO +-\u0026quot;) { let elo1 = $row1field2; let elo2 = $row2field2; $elo1 = elo1.split(\u0026quot; \u0026quot;)[0]; $elo2 = elo2.split(\u0026quot; \u0026quot;)[0]; let elo1change = elo1.split(\u0026quot; \u0026quot;)[1]; let elo2change = elo2.split(\u0026quot; \u0026quot;)[1]; // Remove the parentheses (+16) -\u0026gt; +16. $elo1change = elo1change.substring(1, elo1change.length - 1); $elo2change = elo2change.substring(1, elo2change.length - 1); score_index = 2; } var row1fields = [ $row1field1, $row1field2, $row1field3, $row1field4, $row1field5, $row1field6, ]; var row2fields = [ $row2field1, $row2field2, $row2field3, $row2field4, $row2field5, $row2field6, ]; var $matchscore1 = row1fields[score_index]; var $matchscore2 = row2fields[score_index]; var $round1player1 = row1fields[score_index + 1]; var $round1player2 = row2fields[score_index + 1]; var $round2player1 = row1fields[score_index + 2]; var $round2player2 = row2fields[score_index + 2]; var $round3player1 = row1fields[score_index + 3]; var $round3player2 = row2fields[score_index + 3]; var gameidanddate_parts = $gameidanddate.split(\u0026quot; : \u0026quot;, 2); let $gameid = gameidanddate_parts[0]; // TODO(dbieber): Parse timestamp. let $timestamp = gameidanddate_parts[1]; // formatDate definition elided. let $today = formatDate(new Date());  Future Challenge: Record every game exactly once The current instance of the flow just collects all the games on page 1 into the spreadsheet. What I\u0026rsquo;d really like the flow to do is collect every game once. My flow will run once a day.\nI could do this by parsing the dates, and having the flow collect all the flows less than one day old each time it runs. This wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be robust to missing a day though.\nAnother approach would be to have the flow look in the spreadsheet for the last game collected, and then keep collecting games until that most recently collected game is reached. I\u0026rsquo;ll discuss these options with DK before proceeding. For now, it\u0026rsquo;ll just collect a subset of my games, or collect some games twice if I play fewer than 10 on some day.\n You can find the flows here and here if you have Browserflow.\n","date":1619827200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619827200,"objectID":"a6d7731250af1e4bd661fcc333bf4cc5","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-05-01-table-tennis-flow/","publishdate":"2021-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2021-05-01-table-tennis-flow/","section":"snippets","summary":"In this snippet I chronicle making a Cloud flow that tracks my progress in Eleven Table Tennis VR, a virtual reality table tennis game I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing a bunch over the last month.\nI took a first pass at making the flow earlier in the week, and ran into two hiccups I\u0026rsquo;ll need to work around: (1) The css selectors for my ELO, Rank, etc change between visits to the website.","tags":["table tennis","browserflow"],"title":"Making a Browserflow Flow for Eleven Table Tennis VR","type":"snippets"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This is an incomplete snippet.

It\u0026rsquo;s an online marketplace for soil. If you have soil you\u0026rsquo;re looking to get rid of, or are looking to purchase soil, you can use GetSoils.com to find a buyer or seller for your soil.\nSince he\u0026rsquo;s launching a new marketplace, it needs buyers and sellers on the site for it to be useful. The more people buying and selling soil, the more useful his site becomes, and in turn more people will join to buy and sell their soil \u0026ndash; a virtuous cycle, if he can get the word out.\nSo, part of why I\u0026rsquo;m writing this snippet is to help him get the word out. The website is (as I\u0026rsquo;ve now stated repeatedly) GetSoils.com and if you have soil to buy or sell, I encourage you to give it a try. Posting a listing is free.\nWhy use GetSoils over, say, CraigsList? From what I understand, there are a few reasons: (1) GetSoils is a marketplace specifically for soil, so hopefully it\u0026rsquo;s easier to find a buyer or seller there than on a generic site like CraigsList. (2) GetSoils does analysis to reduce soil travel and maximize soil reuse \u0026ndash; thereby benefiting the environment and keeping costs low. (3) GetSoils has expertise in soil, and helps you ensure compliance with government regulations pertaining to soil, and makes filing the necessary reports easy.\nAlright, with the advertising portion of the snippet complete, I\u0026rsquo;ll now take a few minutes to try and understand the soil market a little bit better.\nThe website supports buying and selling the following soil types: Sand and Gravel, Sands, Silty Sand to Sandy Silt, Clayey Silt to Silty Clay (Glacial Till), Silty Clay, and Topsoil.\nSand, silt, and clay describe the size of soil particles. Sand is the largest, clay is the smallest, and silt lies in between. Gravel soil has even larger particles than sand, containing many small stones.\nThe price of sand and gravel has risen steadily over the last ten years, from $7.30 USD per metric ton in 2010 to $9.60 per metric ton in 2020. In the spirit of using sensible units, let\u0026rsquo;s put this figure into something more tangible than dollars per metric ton for someone like myself who isn\u0026rsquo;t in construction.\nHow about a single liter of soil? There are 625 liters in a metric ton of sand, so a single liter of soil is going to cost (at wholesale prices) 1.5 cents. You might say it\u0026rsquo;s\u0026hellip; dirt cheap. 🥁 (If you actually want to buy such a small volume of soil, you\u0026rsquo;ll probably end up buying 8 liters or so for $5, or 40 lbs for $2.27, a significant markup on the 12 to 20 cents it costs at wholesale prices.)\nDirt may be cheap, but it\u0026rsquo;s bought and sold in huge volume. The smallest soil volume supported on GetSoils is 100 m³. The largest is 200 times that. US consumption of sand and gravel in 2020 reached 68 million metric tons. That\u0026rsquo;s about 17 kilograms of soil consumed per person in the US per month. Did you consume 40 pounds of soil last month?\nThe GetSoils website also allows you to list your bedrock: Weathered Grey Shale (Georgian Bay Formation), Competent Grey Shale (Georgian Bay Formation) Weathered Red Shale (Queenston Formation), Competent Red Shale (Queenston Formation), or Other, as well as any previously placed manufactured materials: Recycled Granulars, Recycled Concrete, Recycled Asphalt, Other.\nSince bedrock can be listed both by buyers and sellers, I think this is for the purpose of buying and selling bedrock. However, it may also be there for logistics and reporting purposes; I\u0026rsquo;m not certain. Weathered vs competent refers to the weathering on the bedrock, with weathered bedrock beginning to turn into soil, and competent bedrock remaining structurally intact.\nGeorgian Bay Formation refers to a particular geoligical formation in Michigan, while Queenston Formation refers to one in Quebec.\nFrom this, I gather that Quebec and Michigan are target markets for the website. The website also lists the five boroughs of New York, so those must be target markets too.\nFrom the listing website, it looks like buying soil is intended for construction projects. Is it also appropriate for small volumes of soil, say for starting a vegetable garden or growing potted plants? The homepage suggests that it is, and the target market includes home owners, builders and developers, haulers and excavators, and other land owners.\nSo \u0026ndash; back to marketing briefly to wrap up \u0026ndash; if you\u0026rsquo;re a home owner, builder, developer, hauler, excavator, or land owner, give GetSoils.com a try today!

The global GDP is about 90 trillion USD. Global oil production is about 100 million barrels per day. The US federal budget for the 2020 fiscal year was set at $4.79 trillion USD.  In this snippet we\u0026rsquo;ll take these statements, complete with their large and unwieldy numbers, and turn them into something a bit more tangible. A common (and very good strategy) for making large numbers tangible is to look at their per capita interpretation. Take the number, divide by the relevant population, and you start to get a better picture of what the number means. As we\u0026rsquo;ll see with our first example, this strategy isn\u0026rsquo;t always enough.\nHow do we make the idea of 7.9 billion people more tangible? Dividing by the world population here would be silly. The population is 1 person per capita. That\u0026rsquo;s not a useful statistic.\nInstead, we can use space and time to make it more tangible.\nPopulation per Unit Space Here are some numbers we may find useful (too big to make immediate sense of for now, but we can deal with that momentarily): The surface area of Earth is 196.9 million mi². Of that, 57.51 million mi² is land area, and only about 24.64 million mi² of that is habitable.\nThis gives us a global population density of 312 people per habitable square mile. Still not the most intuitive for two reasons: 1) a square mile is a pretty large area (Manhattan is 23 mi²; San Francisco is 47 mi²) and imagining 312 people scattered across it can be challenging, 2) the population density varies wildly across different regions (population density in Manhattan is 69,468 people per square mile; in San Francisco its 17,246 people per square mile).\nWe can deal with reason (1) pretty simply. 312 people per habitable square mile is 89353 square feet per person. The Manhattan population density equals merely 401 square feet per person. The San Francisco population density equals 1616 square feet per person.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s tempting to compare these \u0026ldquo;square feet per person\u0026rdquo; figures to typical apartment sizes in these regions. \u0026ldquo;Four hundred square feet per person,\u0026rdquo; we might be tempted to remark, \u0026ldquo;no wonder apartments in the city are so small!\u0026rdquo;\nBefore we do that though, we have to remember two things: First, Manhattan\u0026rsquo;s 23 mi² isn\u0026rsquo;t all apartment space; it also includes public infrastructure like roads and parks, and commercial spaces like stores and offices. Only a fraction of the space is available for living.\nSecond, redeemingly, Manhattan is built up considerably. For every 10-story building built on 400 square feet of habitable land, we get nearly 4000 square feet of potential living space, not a mere 400.\nWe can turn to New York\u0026rsquo;s 2014 ten-year housing plan to add more color to these numbers. There were 3.4 million units across New York City in 2014.\nA bit of Googling suggests the average apartment size in New York City is 700 square feet. Of course this is going to vary considerably by location and apartment type, and I don\u0026rsquo;t know how much we can trust this estimate. Still, let\u0026rsquo;s work with the number. Using the overall NYC population density of 27,000 people per square mile gives 1032 square feet per person. Meanwhile 3.4 million units × 700 ft²/unit at a population of 8.419 million people gives an apartment-population density of just 276 ft²/person. Dense!\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know offhand all the factors I\u0026rsquo;m misrepresenting here. The 3.4 million figure is all housing units, not just apartments. However, the 700 square feet figure is (A) just for apartments, and (B) probably not an average across the whole city.\nTwo main messages to take away from this analysis. (1) New York City is population dense and housing is scarce. (2) You can use space to give a clearer picture of population counts.\nPopulation per Unit Time The global population growth rate is about 1.05% per year. That\u0026rsquo;s interesting, but what does it mean? How does that compare with 1.5% or 2%?\nOur approach to this statement will be to look at the effect of such a growth rate on a more modest size population. In a city of 100,000 (like Mountain View, or New Haven), a growth rate of 1.05% means the population rises by 1050 people each year (about 1850 births and 700 deaths). That means about 5 babies are born in such a city each day!\nIf the growth rate were double (2.1% instead of 1.05%, like it was at its peak in 1962), there would be 10 babies born in a 100,000 person city per day.\nGlobal GDP and the US Federal Budget The global GDP is $90 trillion USD. Dividing by the global population, we see the global GDP is $11,500 USD per capita.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a lot to unpack there that\u0026rsquo;s out of scope for this snippet. For now it suffices that this new figure is a lot more tangible than the original.\nPerforming the same division for the US budget: $4.79 trillion / 328 million people gives a per capita budget of $14,600 USD. Again, there\u0026rsquo;s lots to unpack about this figure out of scope of the snippet, but it immediately makes thinking about budgets a little easier compared with the original figure. Now you can start asking questions like \u0026ldquo;how much should the government be spending on {social security, health care, defense} for me individually, and for the average US citizen?\u0026rdquo; Collective budgeting is a weird problem, perhaps something to learn more about for a future snippet.\nOil Production One final example from my recent time spent learning about oil pricing. Global oil production is about 100 million barrels per day. US oil production is about 10 million barrels per day. How do we make sense of these numbers?\nPer capita figures aren\u0026rsquo;t enough. I think the useful unit for these figures is \u0026ldquo;gallons per person per month\u0026rdquo;. This allows you to think about how much gas your car holds, and how often you have to fill it up. You can compare that with oil production in your country to get a rough sense of the scale of oil production.\nGlobally oil production comes in at 1 barrel per person per 2.6 months. In the US, oil production comes in at 1 barrel per person per month. What\u0026rsquo;s your personal gas consumption rate? How does it compare with the US oil production rate? Are these rates useful to compare?\nRecapping the original statements Here we take each of the original statements the way you might find it in a fact book, and we restate them in more tangible terms.\nOriginal:\n The world population is about 7.9 billion people.  Restated:\n There are 90000 square feet of habitable land per person globally (1000 ft²/person in NYC, and 14000 ft²/person in a typical suburb.)

Eventually (in January 2021) I decided to launch PLG without \u0026ldquo;finishing\u0026rdquo; the idea as I\u0026rsquo;d originally intended. The original idea was going to rely more heavily on automation and in principle could scale well. The actual idea I went with had a fair bit of manual coordination work, but was definitely worthwhile (in part because it actually happened!).\nMy idea for publishing incomplete snippets is: to start, simply publish the snippet with a label \u0026ldquo;incomplete\u0026rdquo; in the title. Then, if I decide to continue the snippet, I will make a copy of the incomplete snippet, and change the date. If I finish it, I will remove incomplete from the title.\nOnce I have a complete version of the snippet (which might sometimes never happen), I can link from the complete version to all the incomplete versions that preceded it. I may also remove the incomplete snippets from the main snippets index once a complete version is available. Or in that main index I may make the main link go to the complete version, with a smaller link that goes to the incomplete version.\nThis idea requires a bit of development, but in the spirit of the idea itself, I think I\u0026rsquo;ll start publishing incomplete snippets even while the incomplete-snippet-publication-idea is itself incomplete.\n","date":1619136000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619136000,"objectID":"72b9a1f9ab77c9fe8ff5a3ffc6179de0","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-23-incomplete-snippets/","publishdate":"2021-04-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2021-04-23-incomplete-snippets/","section":"snippets","summary":"Yesterday and two days ago I started writing a snippet called \u0026ldquo;sensible units \u0026ndash; per capita isn\u0026rsquo;t enough\u0026rdquo;.

The global GDP is about 90 trillion USD. Global oil production is about 100 million barrels per day. The US federal budget for the 2020 fiscal year was set at $4.79 trillion USD.  In this snippet we\u0026rsquo;ll take these statements, complete with their large and unwieldy numbers, and turn them into something a bit more tangible. A common (and very good strategy) for making large numbers tangible is to look at their per capita interpretation. Take the number, divide by the relevant population, and you start to get a better picture of what the number means. As we\u0026rsquo;ll see with our first example, this strategy isn\u0026rsquo;t always enough.\nHow do we make 7.7 billion people more tangible? Dividing by the world population here would be silly. The population is 1 person per capita. That\u0026rsquo;s not a useful statistic.\nInstead, we can use space and time to make it more tangible.\nPopulation in Space Here are some numbers we may find useful (too big to make immediate sense of for now, but we can deal with that momentarily): The surface area of Earth is 196.9 million mi². Of that, 57.51 million mi² is land area, and only about 24.64 million mi² of that is habitable.\nThis gives us a global population density of 312 people per habitable square mile. Still not the most intuitive for two reasons: 1) a square mile is a pretty large area (Manhattan is 23 mi²; San Francisco is 47 mi²) and imagining 312 people scattered across it can be challenging, 2) the population density varies wildly across different regions (population density in Manhattan is 69,468 people per square mile; in San Francisco its 17,246 people per square mile).\nWe can deal with reason (1) pretty simply. 312 people per habitable square mile is 89353 square feet per person. The Manhattan population density equals 401 square feet per person. The San Francisco population density equals 1616 square feet per person.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s tempting to compare these \u0026ldquo;square feet per person\u0026rdquo; figures to typical apartment sizes in these regions. \u0026ldquo;Four hundred square feet per person,\u0026rdquo; we might be tempted to remark, \u0026ldquo;no wonder apartments in the city are so small!\u0026rdquo;\nBefore we do that though, we have to remember two things: First, Manhattan\u0026rsquo;s 23 mi² isn\u0026rsquo;t all apartment space; it also includes public infrastructure like roads and parks, and commercial spaces like stores and offices. Only a fraction of the space is available for living. Second, redeemingly, Manhattan is built up considerably. For every 10-story building built on 400 square feet of habitable land, we get nearly 4000 square feet of potential living space, not a mere 400.\nWe can turn to New York\u0026rsquo;s 2014 ten-year housing plan to add more color to these numbers. There were 3.4 million units across New York City in 2014.\nA bit of Googling suggests the average apartment size in New York City is 700 square feet. Of course this is going to vary considerably by location and apartment type, and I don\u0026rsquo;t know how much we can trust this estimate. Still, let\u0026rsquo;s work with the number. Using the overall NYC population density of 27,000 people per square mile (1032 square feet per person)\nPopulation in Time TODO\nRecapping the original statements Here we take each of the original statements the way you might find it in a fact book, and we restate them in more tangible terms.\nOriginal:\n The world population is about 7.7 billion people.

This was surprising to me, hence this snippet.\nBackground: Collections in Python Python has a few primitive collection types: tuples, lists, dictionaries (aka dicts), and sets. Use parenthesis to create a tuple (1, 2, 3), square brackets to create a list [4, 5, 6], and squirrelly brackets to create a dict or set: {7: 8, 9: 10} makes a dict and {11, 12, 13} makes a set. Just like a set in mathematics, a set in Python is an unordered collection of distinct elements.\nConvenient Syntax Once you\u0026rsquo;ve constructed a set, the following operations allow you to perform set operations on it with clean concise syntax.\n| for union. \u0026amp; for intersection. – for difference ^ for symmetric difference  Operation Examples Here are some examples:\n# Example 1: Disjoint sets (sets that have no elements in common) {1, 2, 3} | {4, 5, 6} == {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} {1, 2, 3} \u0026amp; {4, 5, 6} == set() {1, 2, 3} - {4, 5, 6} == {1, 2, 3} {1, 2, 3} ^ {4, 5, 6} == {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}  Notice how we cannot write {} to create an empty set. That would create an empty dict. Instead we write set(). (You can also write tuple(), list(), and dict() to create empty tuples, lists, or dicts.)\n# Example 2: Overlapping sets {'red', 'green', 'blue'} | {'blue', 'yellow'} == {'red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow'} {'red', 'green', 'blue'} \u0026amp; {'blue', 'yellow'} == {'blue'} {'red', 'green', 'blue'} - {'blue', 'yellow'} == {'red', 'green'} {'red', 'green', 'blue'} ^ {'blue', 'yellow'} == {'red', 'yellow', 'green'}  Set augment operations Each of the operations |, \u0026amp;, -, and ^ has a corresponding \u0026ldquo;augment\u0026rdquo; operation: |=, \u0026amp;=, -=, and ^=.\nWhen you use an augment operation, the operation is applied and the result is assigned back to the variable on the left hand side of the operation.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example of how to use these operations:\n# Example 3: Set augment operations (|=, \u0026amp;=, -=, and ^=) x = {1, 2, 3} x |= {3, 4, 5} print(x) # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} x \u0026amp;= {4, 5, 6} print(x) # {4, 5} x -= {5, 6, 7} print(x) # {4} x ^= {6, 7, 8} print(x) # {4, 6, 7, 8}  Set elements must be hashable Remember, sets can contain any elements as long as they are hashable. So, a set can contain numbers, strings, and bools. A set can also contain tuples, but not lists or dicts or other sets. If you want a set to contain a dict or another set, you can use a \u0026ldquo;frozendict\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;frozenset\u0026rdquo;, which are immutable hashable versions of dicts and sets.\nTo check if an object x is hashable, you can run hash(x). This will return the hash of x if x can be hashed, and will raise a TypeError otherwise.\n","date":1618790400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618790400,"objectID":"65d777c3006835fd07a5865464fda038","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-19-python-set-operations/","publishdate":"2021-04-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2021-04-19-python-set-operations/","section":"snippets","summary":"If you Google \u0026ldquo;Python set intersection\u0026rdquo;, you get a number of results about the set.intersection function.

It\u0026rsquo;s competitive; some highly ranked real-life table tennis players from around the world play this game. My ranking has been going up: my ELO recently reached 2000+, bringing me (at least temporarily) into the top 1500 ranked players online (out of upwards of 440,000 players total.)\nNaturally, I\u0026rsquo;d like to make my number go up. So I practice. I play ranked and unranked games against people around the world. I practice against AI opponents. I use the virtual ball machine. And I watch YouTube videos on how to hit the strokes appropriately.\nOne thing I haven\u0026rsquo;t done though is get a coach.\nA few people have started offering in game virtual reality table tennis coaching. I think this is incredible. The coach and player play at the table simultaneously. They can stand on the same side of the table or opposite each other. They can use a ball machine together or hit with one another. They can discuss table tennis and do exercises together all in game.\nI\u0026rsquo;m interested in giving virtual lessons a try. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how good I\u0026rsquo;d be at receiving coaching though, and this is something I\u0026rsquo;d like to improve at. What makes for a good coach/player relationship? Players need psychological safety. Coaches need to be observant and knowledgeable. Players need to want to improve and ask good questions. Players need to be receptive to the suggestions of the coach. Players need to trust that the coach is focusing on the important aspects of play, so they can focus on the drill at hand. Coaches need to establish this trust. Players have to put in the time to improve.\nThe table tennis quest game is still under active development, and the features that make coaching possible are still young. As I understand it, there aren\u0026rsquo;t special coaching features \u0026ndash; there\u0026rsquo;s just the capability for two people to use around a table optionally with a ball machine.\nSuppose the game developers were to add features to improve the coaching experience. What features would be essential? (1) Record and replay hits from a game or practice (2) Track stats during practice (3) Coach multiple people simultaneously across multiple tables (4) Mix and match replays\nRecord and Replay There are two reasons to want to record and replay hits from a game or practice. One is to learn to defend against them. Say you play against an opponent with a powerful serve or forehand smash. By recording and replaying their attack you can practice defending against it.\nThe second reason to record and replay is to mimic or correct a shot. Let\u0026rsquo;s say you tend to hit your backhand loops into the net. It would be useful to replay the hit as a \u0026ldquo;ghost\u0026rdquo; that you can overlay your real paddle against. In this way you can make subtle adjustments in order to improve this shot. Similarly, you can take the powerful serve or forehand smash from the previous example and learn to mimic it by replaying it repeatedly and following along the motions with your own paddle.\nTrack stats during practice An essential tool for self improvement is numbers that go up: ELO ratings, win counts, balls returned, etc. Giving the ball machine the capability of tracking how many balls you return successfully (where \u0026ldquo;success\u0026rdquo; is something you can define, such as hitting a certain region of the table, perhaps with a certain minimum speed or spin) and how many you miss creates a new metric to improve. And once there\u0026rsquo;s a metric to improve, putting in the time to improve it becomes all the more satisfying.\nI\u0026rsquo;d love if the game could track a metric like this over time. This feature would pair especially well with the next one, allowing a coach to coach multiple people simultaneously, because it would give the coach quick visibility into the progress of the players towards their goals.\nCoaching multiple people across multiple tables Currently coaching is a one on one affair. This is virtual reality though, so the potential for tools for coaching go way beyond what\u0026rsquo;s possible in the real world. A simple place to start is allowing the coach to simultaneously coach multiple people. The coach would do this by having all their students at various tables. The coach could have a multi-table view, where they can monitor all tables at once. Then, through VR magic the coach can quickly teleport to any of the tables to provide individual instruction. The coach can speak with players one on one, or to the whole group simultaneously. Similarly, the coach can set the ball machine settings for individual players or for the whole group. And the coach can pair off players to hit together or play matches or do exercises as they deem appropriate.\nThe ball replay feature is of course also essential in this setting. If the coach observes a particularly good shot on any of the tables, they can capture this and replay it for all the players. Everyone can practice returning this one shot, whether it\u0026rsquo;s a smash, loop, or lob, to improve their table tennis game together.\nMixing and matching replays The record and replay feature is going to be essential to the future of practice. Replaying a single ball over and over is useful, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t capture the dynamic nature of table tennis. So, one useful feature to pair with replaying a shot is the ability to add variance to the shot. In the original recording, the smash has X speed and Y spin and hits precisely position Z. In the replays, all these values can be perturbed slightly to practice variations on the theme. Also, being able to build sequences of replay shots, much in the way you can turn on multiple ball machine settings today, would be a welcome addition for practicing in game situations.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know which of these the game developers have planned. And of those that they have planned (they seem to have everything planned), I wonder which are planned first. Once I\u0026rsquo;ve had my first coaching session, I\u0026rsquo;m sure my feature requests will only grow. Looking forward to it all. 🏓\n","date":1618704000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618704000,"objectID":"a68bb89314d1e33792a423701870eb09","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-18-virtual-table-tennis-coaching/","publishdate":"2021-04-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2021-04-18-virtual-table-tennis-coaching/","section":"snippets","summary":"For the last few weeks I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing virtual reality table tennis quite a lot.

At the time I didn\u0026rsquo;t foresee writing snippets at the same rate I had been leading up to that point. Sure enough, over the two months that followed I only wrote a handful of snippets. March saw two simultaneous Peer Learning Groups, and April lead into a period of intense virtual ping pong playing and lots of real-life hiking.\nWe wrapped up the Peer Learning Groups, a largely asynchronous low-commitment activity, with a virtual synchronous meet-up and coworking session. During these I produced these two snippets about what I learned for my PLG sessions: one on Laser Eye Surgery, one on Oil Pricing. I think this could be the trigger that brings me back into the pattern of writing snippets again, though I\u0026rsquo;m not certain.\nSetting out to write snippets once more, I have a handful of half-baked ideas about what to write about: sleep, ping pong, virtual reality, hiking, the list of ideas from February1, yet more snippets about Browserflow and Roam Research, machine learning research, PLG and other online learning ideas, and pandemic coping are all on my list.\nWhen I sat down today to pen a snippet, I initially thought I would write about my ideas for using virtual reality table tennis for group coaching sessions. It felt funny though; I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure why I was writing it. Was snippets a place to collect good ideas I may want to share with people in the future?\nThis snippet is me taking a moment to reflect on why I write snippets, to reload my old reasoning back into memory, and to see if it still makes sense to me.\nI had a few early reasons. Learning to communicate was a big one early on. Avoiding the addicting nature of social media was part of why I chose to write here, rather than on another platform. Feeling like I was writing for no audience, and the freedoms and desires that I found came with that, was a bigger reason for continuing on this platform rather than another. All of these continue to ring true, though there is one key way in which my writing deviates from its stated purpose.\nWhen I set out to get better at communicating, one of my motivations was for communicating research. I\u0026rsquo;ve hardly written about my research at all! I don\u0026rsquo;t want to make a big change here; I like the type of topic I tend to select for snippets, and I like the expectation that I\u0026rsquo;ve set for myself that I can write about anything, with the bar set extremely low.

This proved far too large a topic to cover in the allotted time, far more so than for any of the other topics I\u0026rsquo;ve studied in a PLG before. Here\u0026rsquo;s what I learned.\nLearning Trajectory I started with Wikipedia and some assorted Googling to get the basics of crude oil, shale, natural gas, to get an idea for their rough production levels around the world, and to learn a bit of history about OPEC. Eventually, I landed on this course from PennState: Energy Markets, Policy, and Regulation.\nThis course is an excellent resource, and I spent about an hour going through the first lesson (of 12), which is about the global market for crude oil. It was well written, interesting, and provided a good not-too-heavy mix of history, geopolitics, and economics to bring me up to speed.\nFuture lessons promise to cover the markets for refined petroleum products, the markets for natural gas, and then further topics on natural gas, electricity, energy regulations, challenges with adopting renewables, and a number of related econ and finance topics.\nIf you want a thorough introduction to the topic, check out the course. If you instead want a lighter more enjoyable exploration of the topic, check out Planet Money Buys Oil, a 20-minute episode of NPR\u0026rsquo;s Planet Money.\nUnderstanding Oil There\u0026rsquo;s crude oil, shale oil, and natural gas. Crude oil is found at a depth of about 6000 ft, and requires the most refining of the three to be useful. Shale oil is found at a depth of about 9000 ft. Natural gas is primarily methane, and requires the least work of the three to refine.\nWithin each of these main categories of oil, there is a large numbers of kinds of oil. Take a look at the futures and indexes listed on these oil price charts to get a sense for how many different kinds of oil trade every day. The two at the top of the charts, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent, are the most important, as those two serve as benchmark oil prices for the rest.\nWhat makes an oil higher or lower quality? Two important dimensions are its sulfur content, and its viscosity. Oils low in sulfur are said to be \u0026ldquo;sweet\u0026rdquo;, while those high in sulfur are termed \u0026ldquo;sour\u0026rdquo;. The lower the sulfur content, the higher quality the oil. Viscosity of crude oil is measured on the API (\u0026ldquo;American Petroleum Institute\u0026rdquo;) gravity scale. Low viscosity oils are called \u0026ldquo;light\u0026rdquo;, and high viscosity oils are called \u0026ldquo;heavy\u0026rdquo;, with lower viscosity being preferable and more valuable than higher viscosity oils.\nWTI is a light sweet oil representative of the US market. Brent is a blend of light sweet crude oils from the North Sea, with just slightly higher levels of sulfur than WTI.\nOil Production Levels US, Russian, and Saudi Arabia all producing near peak rates 9 to 11 million barrels per day. In the US, that works out to about 1 barrel per person per month. In the Russia, production is about 2 barrels per person per month. And in Saudi Arabia, production is about 10 barrels per person per month. (The differences here come from differences in the nations' populations, not from their oil production levels, which are all the same order of magnitude.)\nI like thinking about production in terms of barrels per person per month because you get nice tangible values that you can compare to your own oil usage. How often do you get gas for your car? How long does it take you to go through a barrel of oil yourself? Far more than a month, I\u0026rsquo;m sure.\nA Wee Bit of History There were important oil embargos in 1973 and 1979. I\u0026rsquo;ll summarize what I read about briefly here, but I recommend reading through the course\u0026rsquo;s text rather than this short summary. In 1973: an unwarranted energy scare leads to the Arab oil embargo. The Middle East countries announce a 5% production cut per month as a reaction to the Yom Kippur war between Egypt and Israel. Though they announced a 5% decrease in production, in practice decreased production less than 1%.\nMain takeaway from this event: Cartel coordination is hard! Each country still had an individual profit motive, which prevented the embargo participants from carrying out their stated embargo.\nThe 1979 embargo: An Iranian worker strike lead to oil prices rising. Again, this was mostly due to speculation not an actual production decrease.\nThe main takeaways from these two events: Fear of control due to OPEC is just as powerful (perhaps more so) as the actual control exerted by OPEC. More recently, fear of geopolitical instability in the Middle East and Africa has a similar effect. It\u0026rsquo;s abundantly clear there is so much important history and geopolitics that I haven\u0026rsquo;t gotten to read about yet.\nMy Notes There is lots more from the PennState course. I\u0026rsquo;ll recommend it one last time for anyone who wants to dive deeper into the subject. This is a massive topic and I spent a little under two hours reading about it.

Here\u0026rsquo;s what I learned.\nThe name \u0026ldquo;LASIK\u0026rdquo; LASIK stands for Laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis.\nLasers, which you\u0026rsquo;re probably familiar, emit high power beams of light. This is useful for laser eye surgery because a computer-guided laser can be used to precisely burn away pieces of your cornea in order to reshape your eye and correct your vision.\nIn situ is Latin for \u0026ldquo;on site\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;in position\u0026rdquo;.\nKeratomileusis comes from the Greek κέρας/kéras for horn and σμίλευσις/smileusis for carving, and refers to the reshaping of the cornea that is central to LASIK.\nHow does LASIK work? Laser eye surgery uses a laser to reshape the cornea in your eye. By reshaping the cornea, it changes how your eye refracts light. And if done correctly (as it usually is!), this improves your vision.\nTo access the cornea, the eye surgeon first cuts a flap into the surface of the cornea. This allows the surgeon to move that part of the cornea out of the way, exposing the remainder of the cornea. Once the flap is lifted, the surgeon uses a laser to reshape the cornea. Finally, the flap is returned to its original position and allowed to heal naturally.\nSo, we summarize the process of LASIK with three steps:\n Cut a flap into the cornea Reshape the cornea Reposition the flap to heal  Let\u0026rsquo;s go through the steps one by one.\n1. Cutting a flap into the cornea There are two main approaches used for cutting this initial flap into the cornea: using a microkeratome or a femtosecond laser.\nA microkeratome is not a laser: it\u0026rsquo;s a mechanical device, basically a knife. That\u0026rsquo;s right, with the microkeratome approach the surgeon is more-or-less taking a knife to your eye. It\u0026rsquo;s a special knife though, designed to create the micron-thin slip in the cornea needed to prepare your eye for LASIK.\nThe second approach is the femtosecond laser, so called because its pulses last a few femtoseconds. That\u0026rsquo;s less than a picosecond! ($1\\text{ fs} = 10^{-15}\\text{ s}$)\nThe flap we\u0026rsquo;re making here is really thin, measuring just 83 to 200 micrometers.\n This paper discusses common considerations in management and complications of the flap-cutting step in femtosecond laser LASIK.\nWhat are the possible complications? The paper lists \u0026ldquo;incomplete or partial flaps, free flaps, buttonholes, and small irregular flaps\u0026rdquo; as possible complications when using a microkeratome. The paper also describes the complications as \u0026ldquo;plaguing refractive surgeons\u0026rdquo; rather than plaguing the patients, which I think may be misdirected.\nMy understanding is that femtosecond laser LASIK was steadily on the rise in 2008, and perhaps at this point is the standard approach to LASIK.\nThe paper linked above lists these advantages of femtosecond LASIK over microkeratome LASIK: flap thickness reproducibility, wavefront measurements, stromal bed quality, and biomechanical outcomes.\nRegardless of what approach to cutting the flap the surgeon uses, this step takes just a couple of seconds. In fact, the whole procedure is rather short, lasting no more than a few minutes.\n2. Reshaping the cornea This is the central step of LASIK! This is the step that can actually improve your vision. A computer-guided excimer laser removes part of the cornea, reshaping.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s a \u0026ldquo;computer-guided excimer laser\u0026rdquo;? It\u0026rsquo;s a powerful and precise laser capable of removing as little as 0.25 microns of tissue at a time. The \u0026ldquo;computer-guided\u0026rdquo; part of the laser uses eye-tracking to adjust where it cuts in response to any eye-movements you make.\nOne of the perks of using a computer-guided laser is that it can respond quickly to any eye or head movements you make. If you move a little, it adjusts where it cuts. If you move too much, it shuts off the laser.\nWikipedia informs me that the term \u0026ldquo;excimer\u0026rdquo; in excimer laser is a bit of a misnomer, and that \u0026ldquo;exciplex\u0026rdquo; would be more correct. An exciplex is an excited complex, in our case an excited noble gas halide.\nDuring this step of LASIK, the excimer laser adjusts the shape of the cornea in order to correct the patient\u0026rsquo;s vision. Reshaping the cornea is an effective technique for correcting nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism.\nNearsightedness occurs when the shape of your eye causes light to refract incorrectly such that images are focused in front of your retina, rather than directly on your retina. Similarly, farsightedness occurs when your the shape of your eye causes the image to focus behind your retina. Vision impairments like these are perfect candidates for fixing with LASIK, since they can be remedied simply by modifying the shape of your cornea.\nTo correct nearsightedness, the excimer laser is used to flatten the cornea. This causes incoming light to refract less, such that the focal point is moved further back, toward your retina. For farsightedness, the laser makes the cornea steeper, bringing the focal point forward in your eye. For an astigmatism, it aims to smooth the cornea into a more symmetrical shape.\n3. Repositioning the flap to heal Once the cornea has been reshaped, the surgeon repositions the flap over the cornea. This acts as a natural bandage, and the cornea heals quickly.\nIs anesthesia used? Yes, eye numbing drops are given. You\u0026rsquo;re awake the whole time though. If you move a little, the computer-guidance will account for it. If you move too much, the laser will shut off automatically.\nRisks Loss of vision is very rare. Dry eyes is common. Temporary vision problems like glare are common too.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the complete list of risks I found:\n Dry eyes Glare, halos, double vision Undercorrections Overcorrections Astigmatism Flap problems Regression Vision loss or changes  For myself, I would (naively) be primarily worried about regression. That said, it does seem to be an uncommon issue.\nCosts LASIK is not usually covered by insurance, as it is typically considered elective surgery. The cost of LASIK is reported to be between $\\text{\\$1,000}$ and $\\text{\\$3,000}$ per eye. VSP has this page with a list of questions you should ask to understand exactly what is included in the cost of LASIK (Pre- and post- operative care? Follow-up procedures if fine-tuning is needed? One eye or two?).\nOpen questions: Keep in mind I only spent about an hour researching LASIK. There are many questions I am not qualified to answer. Here are some of the questions I still have:\n How common are each of the risks? How is the flap moved out of the way? How is it repositioned? What do the medical devices and surgery actually look like? For myself, I would be concerned that my vision changes too quickly. Is there a way to measure this to verify or invalidate this concern?

Mobile games today are in an arms race. Make your game more addicting, and your game becomes more profitable. More addicting is not the same as more fun. They may be correlated, but the incentives of video game companies are not wholly aligned with the incentives of the players.\nWhy is it an \u0026ldquo;arms race\u0026rdquo;? There\u0026rsquo;s limited mindshare. Making your game addicting claims more of this mindshare. More engaging games are more profitable. And there\u0026rsquo;s no easy way for a game company to disentangle unhealthy addictive engagement from increased engagement due to increased quality of the game (is this true? will ponder\u0026hellip;)\nDevelopers of these games will A/B test mechanisms and designs and select those that maximize engagement. This isn\u0026rsquo;t unique to video games; it applies to social media and advertising as well, but we\u0026rsquo;ll focus on video games for this snippet.\nEnter the \u0026ldquo;Healthy Games Inter-company Compact\u0026rdquo;. This is a hypothetical future agreement between all the video game companies. The \u0026ldquo;Healthy Games Inter-company Compact\u0026rdquo; (HGIC for short) states that once 100% of game companies agree to the compact, all video games will simultaneously reduce the addictiveness of their games by 20% (the specific number\u0026rsquo;s not central to the idea). Signing the agreement does nothing if not all video game companies have signed. Only once all such companies are signed the agreement does it come into effect. At that point, the agreement comes into effect for all companies at once, and all games are simultaneously made less addicting. (This idea is inspired by the real Popular Vote Interstate Compact.)\nThere are so many reasons why this can\u0026rsquo;t work in practice. In the spirit of taking silly ideas seriously, let\u0026rsquo;s go through those reasons, and perhaps we\u0026rsquo;ll find some of them weaker than first appearance might suggest.\nThe first reason it can\u0026rsquo;t work is that 100% of video game companies agreeing to \u0026ldquo;mutual disarmament\u0026rdquo; would be such an extraordinary feat. Wikipedia estimates that in the US alone there are 2,300 development companies and over 525 publishing companies. What would a consortium of all video game companies even look like? Why would 10% of companies agree to this compact, let alone 100%? A few could agree to it out of genuine interest in the health of their addiction-prone players. A few others could agree to it if it makes strategic sense for them. Getting to 10% seems farfetched, 100% fantastical.\nSecond, even if all the current video game companies did agree, the market is such that a new player could enter the video game industry at any time, disregarding the compact. This HGIC would need to be legislation, not just an inter-company compact, for it to apply to new entrants. This is something I am doubtful I would support, even though the HGIC is my idea. It would proabably even take considerable effort to make a legislative version of the HGIC constitutional! (Is game mechanism design a protected form of speech?)\nThird, even if all current video game companies signed the HGIC, acted in good faith, and even if there were no possibility of new entrants, there still remain the difficult questions of how to measure the reduction in unhealthy addictiveness of games. As a strawman, the HGIC could specify a metric, say play-time per player, and all companies would reduce their play-time per player by an agreed upon percent. I\u0026rsquo;ll readily acknowledge this sounds ridiculous; it could mean ruining the fun of some games, not making them healthier! As a second strawman, the HGIC could specify specific game mechanics and how to adjust them. E.g. it would specify that count-down timers need to be shortened by X% (does that even help?), non-deterministic rewards need to be made Y% more deterministic, etc. I\u0026rsquo;ll readily acknowledge this strawman is ridiculous too; there are likely too many possible game mechanics for an agreement of this form to be manageable to produce. Finding an equivalent reduction in addictiveness across all games is impossible because games are simply too varied.\nFourthly and finally, everyone I\u0026rsquo;ve shared this idea with so far (three people in total) have disagreed with the premise, that the addicting nature of video games is a negative thing, and that reducing it is desirable. This is a real surprise to me. I thought it was generally accepted that the tactics employed by FarmVille, CandyCrush, Covet, and the like are deliberative exploitative and addictive, designed through experimentation to maximize engagement and profit, and that this is a negative aspect of the games. I suppose I was wrong about this (the generally accepted part, that is). Guess I need to expand my bubble.1\nWe now have four solid reasons that the Healthy Games Inter-company Compact could never come into effect. I\u0026rsquo;m sure there are a dozen more. It\u0026rsquo;s nevertheless nice to imagine a world in which a few companies draft and sign the compact, initially thinking it will never come into effect. And then, over time, more companies are drawn to the idea of improving the health of their addiction-prone customers, until eventually the industry enacts and broadly follows guidelines for healthy game development. I think that\u0026rsquo;s a world to aspire to, albeit unrealistic. So while the HGIC in all likelihood won\u0026rsquo;t work, perhaps there\u0026rsquo;s another path there.\n  To get a glimpse of what people think outside my itsy-bitsy social bubble, you can have a look at these mixed reviews of CandyCrush from parents and children. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1615161600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615161600,"objectID":"0d3456209820958f2a78d751f62ee791","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-03-08-healthy-games-inter-company-compact/","publishdate":"2021-03-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2021-03-08-healthy-games-inter-company-compact/","section":"snippets","summary":"This snippet is a silly, currently unworkable, but in my opinion still worthwhile idea to improve the healthiness of video games.

The idea is to fill my Twitter feed with things that I care about, rather than letting the Twitter algorithm control my attention. By programmatically injecting cards into my Twitter feed I can repurpose the time I spend scrolling on Twitter from time lost to time well spent.\nThis post explains, step-by-step, how you can build your own private Twitter bot so you too can repurpose the time you spend doom-scrolling.\nOverview In this guide you\u0026rsquo;ll see how to set up a private personal Twitter bot that only you can follow. We\u0026rsquo;ll use this to inject content directly into your own feed. In order to choose what to Tweet, we\u0026rsquo;ll extract content from our Roam Research database. Here are the six steps we\u0026rsquo;ll follow.\n  Set up a private Twitter account\n  Get your developer API keys\n  Use the twython library to post as your new Twitter account\n  Write the tweet generator; I pull my tweets from Roam Research\n  Use the schedule library to periodically tweet\n  (Bonus) Use supervisord to keep your Twitter bot running\n  Step 1: Set up a private Twitter account Go ahead and register a new Twitter account. I called mine \u0026ldquo;@PrivateBieber6\u0026rdquo; since my main account is just @Bieber. You can call yours whatever you like!\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll have to provide a phone number or email address while registering. If you reuse a phone number from an existing account, it will work, but you\u0026rsquo;ll lose the ability to use SMS commands and receive SMS notifications on your main account. Only the account most recently linked to this phone number will have these features.\nPro-tip: you can add a plus (\u0026quot;+\u0026quot;) string to your email address to turn in into a new email address that still gets delivered to your inbox. E.g. mail to david810+hello@gmail.com still gets delivered to david810@gmail.com (feel free to say hello).\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve created your new account, two important things to do:\n  Follow it from your main account!\n  Set it to protected. To do this, go to your settings ( https://twitter.com/settings/account), choose \u0026ldquo;Privacy and safety\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Audience and tagging\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt; Protect your Tweets.\n  With this enabled, you\u0026rsquo;ll be the only one able to see the tweets from this account.\nStep 2: Get your developer API keys First you need to apply for a developer account. This just takes a minute. Go to https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access to apply for a developer account. Answer the questions honestly. Ping me on Twitter if any of the questions are unclear.\nOnce you have a developer account, create a new project and app. I called mine \u0026ldquo;Attention Playground.\u0026rdquo; Get creative! Choose a fun name.\nNavigate to your newly created app, and Edit the \u0026ldquo;App permissions\u0026rdquo;. Set the app permissions to \u0026ldquo;Read and Write\u0026rdquo;. This will enable your bot to post tweets.\nNext navigate to the project you created, and click the key icon next to your App.\nWrite down your API key and API secret key. Generate an Access token and secret and write those down too. Your access token \u0026amp; secret should say \u0026ldquo;Created with Read and Write permissions\u0026rdquo;.\nThese four tokens will be essential in the next steps.\nStep 3: Use twython to tweet as your new account Now things get a bit technical. Install the twython Python library by running pip install twython from your shell. If you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar with installing Python packages, you can learn how to do this here1.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s send a practice tweet. Create a new file called hellotweet.py with the following code:\nimport twython client = twython.Twython( \u0026quot;YOUR_API_KEY\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;YOUR_API_SECRET_KEY\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET\u0026quot;) def sendTweet(text): return client.update_status(status=text) sendTweet(\u0026quot;Hello world!\u0026quot;)  On lines 4-7, place the keys you got from Step 2 in stead of the placeholders I\u0026rsquo;ve included above.\nNow, run your program! python hellotweet.py\nIf everything\u0026rsquo;s worked, you\u0026rsquo;ll have a new tweet from your private account saying \u0026ldquo;Hello world!\u0026rdquo;\nDon\u0026rsquo;t move on to the next steps until you get this working.\nStep 4: Write the tweet generator; I pull my tweets from Roam Research The simplest possible tweet generator looks like this:\nimport random def choose_message(): messages = [\u0026quot;Tweet 1: Make spaghetti\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Tweet 2: Learn about salmon\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Tweet 3: Call Mom\u0026quot;] return random.choice(messages)  We\u0026rsquo;re going to write a more interesting tweet generator that pulls tweets out of a Roam Research database.\nTo do this, first set up a recurring json backup of your Roam Research database. You can use the project roam2github to set up the backup. There are detailed instructions on its github page for how to do this. You also have the option of using Roam\u0026rsquo;s built-in automatic backups, which you access from the command palette (cmd-P).\nUse git to clone your backup locally. If your github repo is \u0026ldquo;https://github.com/user/roam-backup\u0026quot;, then the command to clone the repo is git clone https://github.com/dbieber/roam-backup.\nCreate roam.py. You can copy the contents of roam.py from here. This will allow us to pull the latest backup of our Roam database from GitHub programmatically. (1) Set the ROAMRESEARCH_DBPATH variable in roam.py to the location of json backup in your roam-backup directory. For me, this is \u0026lsquo;/Users/dbieber/code/github/dbieber/roam-backup/json/playground.json\u0026rsquo;. (2) Set the roam_dir variable in the update function to the path to your roam-backup directory. For me, this is \u0026lsquo;/Users/dbieber/code/github/dbieber/roam-backup\u0026rsquo;.\nUsing the new roam module we just created, it\u0026rsquo;s time to write a function that extracts potential tweets from your Roam database. Here\u0026rsquo;s the function I use:\ndef choose_message(): all_children = roam.get_children() messages = [] for child in all_children: if ('Fleeting TODOs' in child['string'] or 'Distraction TODOs' in child['string']): children = child.get('children', []) for c in children: if (c['string'] and 'DONE' not in c['string'] and len(c['string']) \u0026lt;= 280): messages.append(c['string']) return random.choice(messages)  The get_children function gets all the blocks from your Roam graph backup. The for loop looks through all these blocks for ones that say \u0026ldquo;Fleeting TODOs\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Distraction TODOs\u0026rdquo;. It takes the children of those blocks (except those that are too long or say \u0026ldquo;DONE\u0026rdquo;) as potential tweets. One of those is selected randomly each time choose_messages is called.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s our whole tweet generator. In the next step, we\u0026rsquo;ll pull the Roam backup from GitHub periodically automatically so it\u0026rsquo;s always somewhat up to date, and we\u0026rsquo;ll schedule the bot to tweet every ten minutes.\nStep 5: Use the schedule library to periodically tweet The schedule library is a useful Python library for scheduling tasks to run at a particular time or on a recurring basis.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a simple demonstration of how to use schedule to print \u0026ldquo;Hello world!\u0026rdquo; every 15 minutes:\nimport schedule def print_hello_world(): print('Hello world!') schedule.every(15).minutes.do(print_hello_world) while True: schedule.run_pending() time.sleep(30)  We don\u0026rsquo;t want to print hello world though; we want to tweet!\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to use schedule to schedule two recurring tasks: (1) every 6 hours we\u0026rsquo;ll pull the latest Roam backup from GitHub, (2) every 10 minutes we\u0026rsquo;ll have our Bot pick a random block using the logic from the previous step and tweet it to twitter.\nThe code for that looks like this:\ndef tweet(): message = choose_message() sendTweet(message) def main(): schedule.every(10).minutes.do(tweet) schedule.every(360).minutes.do(roam.update) while True: schedule.run_pending() time.sleep(30)  Putting it all together, our complete code now looks like this:\n\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;Every 10 minutes selects a topic from my Roam database and tweets it from a private Twitter account. \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; import random import time import schedule import roam import twython client = twython.Twython( \u0026quot;YOUR_API_KEY\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;YOUR_API_SECRET_KEY\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET\u0026quot;) def sendTweet(text): return client.update_status(status=text) def choose_message(): all_children = roam.get_children() messages = [] for child in all_children: if ('Fleeting TODOs' in child['string'] or 'Distraction TODOs' in child['string']): children = child.get('children', []) for c in children: if (c['string'] and 'DONE' not in c['string'] and len(c['string']) \u0026lt;= 280): messages.append(c['string']) return random.choice(messages) def tweet(): message = choose_message() sendTweet(message) def main(): schedule.every(10).minutes.do(tweet) schedule.every(360).minutes.do(roam.update) while True: schedule.run_pending() time.sleep(30) if __name__ == '__main__': main()  Make sure that both the \u0026ldquo;tweet\u0026rdquo; function and \u0026ldquo;roam.update\u0026rdquo; run successfully.\nSave this as roam-tweeter.py. You can now run it with python roam-tweeter.py.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s it! While this is running, your Twitter bot will post a new tweet to twitter every ten minutes. Using this, you can flood your Twitter timeline with things you care about, whether that\u0026rsquo;s your TODOs, spaced repetition, or old ideas you want to revisit.\nStep 6 (Bonus): Use supervisord to keep your Twitter bot running This is an optional step, but highly worthwhile! Supervisord is a utility you can use to monitor processes and automatically restart them if they die. If you plan on using your computer for long-running processes like a Twitter bot, this can save you lots of headaches.\nFollow the instructions at supervisord.org to get set up. The key steps are:\nTo install supervisord, use pip install supervisord\nAdd a config for running your Twitter bot. Mine looks like this:\n[program:private-bieber-twitter] command=/Users/dbieber/.virtualenvs/_3/bin/python roam-tweeter.py directory=/Users/dbieber/code/playground/private-bieber-twitter  Notice that I\u0026rsquo;ve included the full Path to python in the command.\nFinally, start supervisord with sudo indicating the path to the config. (e.g. for me the command is sudo /Users/dbieber/.virtualenvs/_3/bin/supervisord -c ~/path/to/supervisord.conf)\nWith supervisord set up, you\u0026rsquo;re bot is now bullet-proof! (Not bug-proof though.) Even if it encounters an error, it will automatically restart.\nWrap-up Hopefully this guide makes it clear how you can use a private Twitter bot to reclaim your attention. The main contribution of this guide is its emphasis on using a private Twitter bot to design your own personal Twitter feed. We selected Roam Research backups as the source of tweets for our bot, but of course you can substitute Roam with any tweet generator that you please.\nYou can use a bot like this for revisiting old ideas, for surfacing your TODOs when you\u0026rsquo;re distracted, for sending yourself messages, or anything else you come up with.\nSince making myself a private Twitter bot one month ago, I\u0026rsquo;ve been delighted to find that its tweets are often among the highest quality on my timeline. I hope you find the same.\n  When it says that using a virtual environment is optional, know that it\u0026rsquo;s definitely worthwhile! \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1615075200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615075200,"objectID":"ac3d8de8d74b76b5fa31dac891fbc9fe","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/post/2021-03-07-roam-twitter-bot-dev-guide/","publishdate":"2021-03-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2021-03-07-roam-twitter-bot-dev-guide/","section":"post","summary":"Use this guide to build a Roam Research Twitter bot that only you can see, to reclaim your attention when scrolling.","tags":null,"title":"A Step-by-Step Developer Guide to Building a Personal Roam-to-Twitter Bot","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The \u0026ldquo;Efficient Minds Hypothesis\u0026rdquo; states that a person is able to reach whatever conclusions they are able to reach in a small finite amount of time. Unless new information is presented, after that small duration no new conclusions will be reached. Stated more succinctly, the Efficient Minds Hypothesis states that \u0026ldquo;thinking is near-instantaneous.\u0026rdquo;\nThis is of course, preposterous. However, when it is not named and stated so explicitly, believing the EMH is an easy trap to fall into.\nThere are negative consequences to believing the EMH, even implicitly or subconsciously. It can lead to asking fewer questions. It can lead to scheduling less time for planning and Great Thoughts, and spending too large a proportion of your time on building and chasing short-term goals. It can lead to too much self-reliance, and a reluctance to delegate or share the burden of a project with others.\nWhile the Efficient Minds Hypothesis is mainly a strawman that I don\u0026rsquo;t think many people would claim to believe outright, I do think it\u0026rsquo;s an idea that people (at least myself) sometimes believe implicitly. Making it explicit helps to make its status as a fallacy clearer.\nI write about the Efficient Minds Hypothesis from personal experience. While I don\u0026rsquo;t consciously believe the EMH (as I stated above, I think it\u0026rsquo;s preposterous), I find that beneath the surface of my thoughts I often do believe it, and can act or think accordingly. Being surrounded by creative intelligent people at work, spending every day thinking about challenging problems, the falsity of the EMH (at least with respect to my own mind), has been crystal clear day after day.\nIts falsity is most clear when a colleague suggests a solution to a problem that I have that I have not seen. The solution feels like something simple enough to arrive at quickly given my experience, but it is apparently not, for it\u0026rsquo;s a solution I did not foresee. On N occasions it has even been the case that I have not even begun to properly start thinking about the problem when a colleague presents the solution, perhaps because there are many possible problems to attend to, and selecting where to place one\u0026rsquo;s attention is a problem in itself.\nUnder the EMH, the idea that you can present a problem to a colleague without first having given it the small finite first attempt doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense. If EMH were true, you would present only problems that you cannot yourself solve to your colleagues. In the time it takes to present a problem, you would have attempted solving it yourself.\nThe maxims of \u0026ldquo;bring me solutions, not problems\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t come to me until you\u0026rsquo;ve worked this out as much as you can on your own\u0026rdquo; are weakened by the lack of an EMH too. Sometimes you need to engage other minds simply to parallelize computation, not because one mind alone cannot solve something. The benefits of multiple minds go beyond parallelization though. Freshness and specialization are two principles that make a collaboration more than the sum of its parts.\nWhy believe the EMH at all?\nWhen young, when working on easier problems, when you can anticipate what comes next, when your mind is fresh, well rested, and well equipped for the tasks at hand, the EMH can appear and feel true. A quick look at any complex task, say chess or a hard math problem, makes it apparent that it\u0026rsquo;s not universally true. But those System 2 tasks do nothing to dispel the EMH in System 1 heavy situations.1\nIt isn\u0026rsquo;t always apparent that thinking takes time. It isn\u0026rsquo;t always apparent that System 1 thinking in particular takes time. It isn\u0026rsquo;t always apparent that something requires System 2 thought. And finally it isn\u0026rsquo;t always apparent that thinking has bandwidth, and that ideas and projects can be thought-bandwidth bottlenecked.\nThe result is that we need to be deliberate with how we choose to spend our brainpower. And this starts with being mindful and intentional with our attention.\n As an exercise for the reader: Would the Efficient Minds Hypothesis imply the Efficient Market Hypothesis? How about the reverse?\n  \u0026ldquo;System 1\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;System 2\u0026rdquo; refer to Kahneman\u0026rsquo;s dichotomy of fast intuitive (System 1) vs slow, deliberate, planned (System 2) thought from Thinking, Fast and Slow. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1614864960,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614864960,"objectID":"7535f9e1cbeefe2ab41cd7e4710626a9","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-03-04-the-efficient-minds-hypothesis/","publishdate":"2021-03-04T13:36:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2021-03-04-the-efficient-minds-hypothesis/","section":"snippets","summary":"The \u0026ldquo;Efficient Minds Hypothesis\u0026rdquo; states that a person is able to reach whatever conclusions they are able to reach in a small finite amount of time.

Each command issued in the shell will become a block hidden behind the terminal (nested but collapsed). The output of each command will become a block as well.\nWhat sorts of commands do you want to be able to issue from within Roam? Deploying snippets. Querying the Roam graph. sshing into another machine and using it natively. Treating Roam like a file system.\nOf course I\u0026rsquo;d like all the basic shell features (history, basic unix commands sed/grep/ls/cd/awk/\u0026hellip;, piping).\nI\u0026rsquo;d also like my commands to be able to use my Roam content as inputs. I\u0026rsquo;d like a new type of shell expansion \u0026ndash; expanding block references. echo $((7yNZl3Gf-)) will echo the contents of that block (precise syntax tbd).\nPages in the Roam database can be treated like files. cat [[Roam Research]] will output the full contents of the Roam Research page of my graph.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll have new primitives too, like the unix classics, more suited for the Roam data structure. List all references on a page. grep that list for a keyword. Sort by date. refs Roam Research | grep Conor | sort -t. There would be primitives for accessing a block\u0026rsquo;s children, parents, refs, backrefs, etc.\nOf course you can write your own commands too. Like Python Fire, we\u0026rsquo;ll provide a mechanism to trivially translate any javascript/closure function in your roam/js into a command line utility. The function name becomes the command name. The function arguments become its flags. Help is generated automatically.\nThe real power comes from being able to apply the unix philosophy simultaneously on Roam and on a remote machine. How does this look? Maybe the Roam graph is mounted as a filesystem on the remote machine. /roam/pages/Roam Research.md views [[Roam Research]] as a markdown file. Also viewable as json or edn. Syntactic sugar provided by the shell allows you to operate directly on \u0026ldquo;[[Roam Research]]\u0026rdquo; allowing for natural commands like the one above.\nYou can write to pages and blocks via these unix utilities too. Makes it super easy to copy data between the remote machine and your graph in both directions.\nHow to implement this? roam/render may be essential. Secure shell app (chrome extension) suggests feasibility. There\u0026rsquo;s a wikipedia page on Web-based SSH for inspiration. xterm.js is used in loads of places for javascript-based terminals.\nRerunning a command from your shell history? Appears as a block reference. Even works for modified commands.\nThis just comes for free for being in Roam: you can tag your commands to make them easy to find later. In bash # starts a comment, so the syntax for tagging tag-teams nicely with bash\u0026rsquo;s syntax. Similarly using block and page references in your commands pages it easy to resurface them.\nFor v0 we don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily need a roam/render UI. Instead we could just write some roam/js that listens for ENTER on blocks nested below \u0026ldquo;{{roam/terminal}}\u0026rdquo;. When ENTER is pressed, the block\u0026rsquo;s contents are parsed, the command gets run, output gets streamed to a new block nested below the command. I think a specialized UI could go a long way though. At the very least history search and tab completion are pretty essential shell features, and there are so many more (e.g. curses, colors).\nAs I wrap up this idea, I\u0026rsquo;ll also point out the deep similarity between terminal UIs and chat UIs. Both are at their core just call and response. In one you communicate with the computer, in the other with human beings. (With Bieber Bot and my Messager project, it\u0026rsquo;s not always clear which is which 😃.) Details like the number of participants, the format of messages, and whether a response can be issued without a corresponding call are just that: details.\nIf we could get a solid terminal experience, legitimately enabling developers to make Roam their default shell, the fusing of note-taking, thinking, and command-issuing that would result would be super powerful. All just a half-baked idea, for now.

I\u0026rsquo;ve skipped about 7 days recently! Now, I don\u0026rsquo;t have any sort of quota that I\u0026rsquo;m aiming for (unlike last year, where I wanted to communicate publicly 100 times.) So, this isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily a problem. Still, good to reflect on why I\u0026rsquo;ve slowed down in writing snippets and where I\u0026rsquo;ll go next.\nMy recent snippets have been: quirky small Python projects1, lots of Roam and Browserflow projects2, and some Peer Learning Group planning3. Essentially, almost all my writing has been project-based, usually about programming projects. It\u0026rsquo;s been a month since I\u0026rsquo;ve written about an idea I\u0026rsquo;m not actually acting on4. Let\u0026rsquo;s do more of those. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to set an expectation of myself that I write code or organize a big event for every little snippet. Snippets are supposed to be almost as easy for me to write and publish (but not to broadcast) as it is for me to think. So, self, expect some low-effort low-quality snippets in the coming weeks as we reset this expectation.\nThis growing implicit expectation could be one reason for skipping several days lately. Another is the \u0026ldquo;OPP Back-pressure\u0026rdquo;. OPP stands for \u0026ldquo;Other People\u0026rsquo;s Projects.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;ve found myself writing a lot about Roam Research, and a bit about Browserflow, both OPP.

I\u0026rsquo;ve skipped about 7 days recently! Now, I don\u0026rsquo;t have any sort of quota that I\u0026rsquo;m aiming for (unlike last year, where I wanted to communicate publicly 100 times.) So, this isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily a problem. Still, good to reflect on why I\u0026rsquo;ve slowed down in writing snippets and where I\u0026rsquo;ll go next.\nMy recent snippets have been: quirky small Python projects1, lots of Roam and Browserflow projects2, and some Peer Learning Group planning3.","tags":null,"title":"Snippets Dry Spell","type":"snippets"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this snippet I introduce and implement, but do not condone, Python \u0026ldquo;Magic functions\u0026rdquo;. Magic functions are interesting to think about and to study, but I discourage their use in anything but the most experimental of code. You\u0026rsquo;ll soon see why.\nA magic function is a function where the arguments and return values are both implicit, handled through the magic of Python\u0026rsquo;s powerful stack introspection.\nConsider the following example, which implements the quadratic formula. Pay special attention to where quadratic_formula is called. No arguments are passed, and the result is not assigned to anything. Still, the program works.\nimport math import magic def quadratic_formula(context): magic.unpack(context) discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c x0, x1 = ( (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a), (-b - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a), ) return magic.context() def main(): a, b, c = 1, -1, -12 magic.call(quadratic_formula) print(f'x = {x0} or {x1} (Discriminant is {discriminant})') if __name__ == '__main__': main()  We say quadratic_formula is a \u0026ldquo;magic function\u0026rdquo;, and it is called by invoking magic.call.\nWhen we run this program, the result is:\nx = 4.0 or -3.0 (Discriminant is 49)  How did a, b, and c get passed to quadratic_formula? How did x0, x1, and discriminant find their way back to main? This is the magic of magic functions.\nTo implement a magic function, simply write a function that accepts a single argument context, calls magic.unpack(context) as its first line, and returns with return magic.context().\nTo call a magic function, use magic.call(fn) as in the example above.\nTo \u0026ldquo;install\u0026rdquo; magic, so that you can import it as in the example above, simply save the following three-function Python file as magic.py in the directory where you\u0026rsquo;d like to use magic functions.\nimport inspect def call(fn, n=1): c = context(n=n+1) result = fn(c) unpack(result, n=n+1) def context(n=1): c = {} caller = inspect.stack()[n] caller_frame = caller[0] caller_globals = caller_frame.f_globals caller_locals = caller_frame.f_locals c.update(caller_globals) c.update(caller_locals) return c def unpack(c, n=1): caller = inspect.stack()[n] caller_frame = caller[0] caller_frame.f_globals.update(c)  These twenty lines of code comprise the complete implementation of the magic module. Magic works by inspecting the stack to get the locals and globals when calling a magic function and when returning from a magic function \u0026ndash; this is done in the context function. Magic then makes use of stack inspection a second time to update the globals in the caller after a magic function returns \u0026ndash; this is done in unpack.\nWhat purpose does this all serve? Why would you ever want to use magic functions? The short answer is that you should never use magic functions. They will confuse readers of your code and are error prone. Nevertheless, I will explain the situation that prompted me to write this module.\nI wanted to write a machine learning training loop and reuse it for many different machine learning training pipelines. Each of the training pipelines needed to track metrics in its own way, save summaries in its own way, make plots in its own way, etc. A natural way to support all of these different needs is with hooks. A hook is a user provided callback function that the training loop library can call each iteration through the loop.\nThe trouble with hooks in this situation is that they require either very long argument lists, or bundling of many arguments into a single argument. If different functions need different bundles of arguments, the bundling approach can be quite cumbersome. Also, if two hooks wish to communicate with one another, that needs to be accommodated too. Magic functions provide one mechanism for dealing with this complexity. Different magic hooks can make use of different parts of the training loop\u0026rsquo;s state. A magic hook can also use state set by another hook. While this approach does satisfactorily address the complexity of writing a training loop library, I must stress that I do not recommend this approach.\nAs with real magic, use magic at your own peril. 🧙‍♀️ 😉\n","date":1613520000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613520000,"objectID":"b6a3bbaa741e2d64fa8dfc4c38b29642","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-17-python-magic-functions/","publishdate":"2021-02-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2021-02-17-python-magic-functions/","section":"snippets","summary":"In this snippet I introduce and implement, but do not condone, Python \u0026ldquo;Magic functions\u0026rdquo;.

Today\u0026rsquo;s snippet is about a feature of Python Fire, new in v0.4.0, and how you can use it to create Python Fire executables just by adding a shebang to an existing Python file. This idea is courtesy of c6401 in GitHub issue #319. The shebang line is #!/usr/bin/env -S python3 -m fire.\nThe feature introduced in fire v0.4.0 is that python -m fire now accepts filepaths.\nSuppose you have a Python file at path/to/module.py. Previously, you could invoke module.py as a Fire CLI with the command python -m fire path.to.module. That still works, but now you can also use the command python -m fire path/to/module.py. This is roughly equivalent to running module.py and then calling fire.Fire() as the final line of the module.\nA consequence of this new feature is that the shebang #!/usr/bin/env -S python3 -m fire allows you to create executable CLIs out of Python files. /usr/bin/env -S is explained here. To create a Python Fire executable, simply add the shebang line as the first line of the file, and then use chmod +x to mark the file as executable.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a quick example:\n Save it as e.g. shebang.py, run chmod +x shebang.py to make it executable, and run it with ./shebang.py hello --name=David\n\u0026gt; ./shebang.py hello --name=David Hello David!

I\u0026rsquo;m targeting a group of about 6-8 people.\nBehind the scenes, I will be contacting everyone to learn what they are interested in learning about. I\u0026rsquo;ll coordinate with you to figure out 1 or 2 topics for you to teach the group about. We\u0026rsquo;ll try to choose topics that both excite you and that someone else in the group is interested in. We\u0026rsquo;ll also select a day for you to do the learning and teaching.\nOn the chosen day, you\u0026rsquo;ll be expected to spend about an hour learning about the selected topic, and sharing what you learn with the group chat. You\u0026rsquo;re welcome to learn about the topic in advance, but that\u0026rsquo;s absolutely not required!\nHow you share what you\u0026rsquo;ve learned with the group is up to you, but the bar is low. There\u0026rsquo;s no expectation of putting together a lesson plan. Instead, I\u0026rsquo;m envisioning you \u0026ldquo;live tweeting\u0026rdquo; interesting things as you learn them, putting quotes, images, and explanations into the chat that you think communicate the main ideas clearly. But I\u0026rsquo;ll reiterate: how you share what you\u0026rsquo;ve learned is completely up to you, and we\u0026rsquo;re setting our expectations low.\nEveryone else is welcome to discuss, ask questions, share insights, etc. The chat is there for you to use how you please.\nSince an hour is a relatively short period of time, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to allocate topics to you that are at the fringes of your expertise already. My theory is that while an hour is fairly short, it will still be really rewarding to hear what someone else learns from a concentrated hour of study.\nAt the end of the four week period, you\u0026rsquo;ll have \u0026ldquo;presented\u0026rdquo; once or twice, and collectively we\u0026rsquo;ll have learned about ~10 different topics in total.\nThe goal is to meet people and learn new things, and also to have fun. So come curious and with an open mind, and we\u0026rsquo;ll do our best to make this an interesting and enjoyable month.\n","date":1612656000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612656000,"objectID":"30299a2fe9bd9a2674b366583b4556f3","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-07-peer-learning-group-sign-up/","publishdate":"2021-02-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2021-02-07-peer-learning-group-sign-up/","section":"snippets","summary":"Peer Learning Group is an experiment for learning new things and meeting new people.

Fewer topics per day In the first round of Peer Learning Group, we had a topic almost every single day, with just two days off in the middle.\nIn the next round, I\u0026rsquo;ll either have fewer people or a longer period of time for the program (e.g. 4-6 weeks), such that there\u0026rsquo;s only ever someone teaching every 3-5 days.\nThis gives more time to think, reflect, and breathe. More time to have adhoc discussions without feeling like you\u0026rsquo;re talking out of turn. More time for questions and connections between topics to bubble up. More time for unrelated topics to come up.\n2. Give people topics they\u0026rsquo;re interested in In the first round of Peer Learning Group, I aimed to give people topics at the edge of their expertise. I tried to give people a topic that would really interest someone else in the group. In the next iteration, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to pick topics for people that more closely align with their own interests. Still not things that they\u0026rsquo;re experts in already, but rather topics that they\u0026rsquo;re excited to learn about themselves. I\u0026rsquo;ll still aim to make sure the topics we choose are interesting to other people in the group too.\n3. Choose a unifying theme for the group, maybe In the first round, the topics were pretty diverse: we had \u0026ldquo;cultivating conscious leadership\u0026rdquo;, the Ethereum EVM, Jungian archetypes, Microbubbles, carcinisation, complexity management, and several more. There was minimal overlap in the ~40 topic suggestions I received while setting up the group.\nFor the next round, I\u0026rsquo;m toying with the idea of picking an overarching topic, like climate change, machine learning, math, or physics.\nCurious to hear what people think of this idea.\n4. Encourage use of background knowledge This is more about my own teaching experience than running the group overall. As I was teaching my topic (Asynchronous Teaching), I was initially reticent to share things I already knew, instead focusing on sharing only what I learned during my teaching session. In retrospect, it is definitely valuable to share background knowledge, not just newly obtained information.\nCurious to hear if other people had a similar experience to myself on this.\n5. Include a synchronous component Pretty much everything was asynchronous in the first group. Not too late to change this though! Even though our Peer Learning Group experiment is coming to a close, we can still set up a synchronous social gathering for next week.\n6. Ask more questions This is a personal change I would make, not a group change. In the next round, I\u0026rsquo;m going to make more of an effort to ask well thought out questions on many of the topics.\nThank you I really enjoyed the first Peer Learning Group. Every evening there was a new thread about an interesting topic delivered to my inbox via messenger. We learned so much, and I had a great time with it.

The rules for when to send a kangaroo 🦘 are as follows:\nYou get a kangaroo if the most-recent message in our chat (ignoring trivial messages from you) is non-trivial, read-by-me, written-by-you, not a response, and eight-hours old.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at each of these criteria in more detail.\nMost-recent message The criteria are being applied to the most recent message in our chat ignoring trivial messages from you.\nIn SQL, this looks like\nselect thread_id, max(timestamp) as timestamp from messenger where (author = '1409114395' or (author \u0026lt;\u0026gt; '1409114395' and LENGTH(text) \u0026gt; 15)) group by thread_id;  1409114395 is my Facebook ID.\nThis query selects the most recent timestamp from only a single message in each thread. It considers all messages from me, but only non-trivial (more than 15 characters) messages from the other participant.\nThe reason for this is that if I have sent the most recent message in a conversation (regardless of the length of the message), then no kangaroo is needed. If the other person has sent the most recent message, a kangaroo might be in order, but trivial messages should not trigger kangaroos. So we ignore them, and see if the most recent message is still from the other person even when ignoring their trivial messages.\nNon-trivial We choose 15-characters as the threshold for what makes a message trivial. The reason we ignore trivial messages is because they often don\u0026rsquo;t warrant a response. I am considering removing this constraint, as the \u0026ldquo;Not a response\u0026rdquo; constraint seems to obviate the need for it.\nThis shows up as LENGTH(text) \u0026gt; 15) in the query.\nRead-by-me Unfortunately I do not have read receipt information in my messages database, so I did not include this rule in the first version of the Kangaroo Auto-responder.\nWritten-by-you Only if the most recent message is from you is a kangaroo necessary. If its from me, I\u0026rsquo;ve already responded!\nIn this query, this is a simple check:\nWHERE messenger.author \u0026lt;\u0026gt; '1409114395'  Not-a-response This is an interesting piece. When I wrote out the rules for the auto-responder yesterday, I was thinking I\u0026rsquo;d ignore messages sent within 5 minutes of a message I sent. My thinking was that this small filter would prevent me from needing to get the last word in every conversation to avoid oversending of kangaroos.\nNow, I\u0026rsquo;m thinking I\u0026rsquo;ll ignore messages sent within 36 hours of a message I sent. This is a much tighter restriction. It means that I may miss sending some kangaroos that I ought to have sent, but it also means that if someone takes two hours to reply to me and that\u0026rsquo;s the end of the conversation, I don\u0026rsquo;t need to reply to prevent a kangaroo from going out.\nIt seems like striking a good balance between the non-trivial message criteria and the not-a-response criteria is key, and I may adjust these going forward.\nTo determine if a message is a response, I first determine the time of my own most recent message in the chat. In SQL, this is:\nselect thread_id, max(timestamp) as outgoing_timestamp from messenger where author = '1409114395' -- my FB id group by thread_id;  I then compare this message\u0026rsquo;s timestamp with that of the most recent message in the thread, which we selected earlier:\n( -- The reply is at least X minutes after my latest message. (latest_messages.timestamp - outgoing_timestamp)/1000 \u0026gt; 36*60*60 or outgoing_timestamp IS NULL )  8-hours old The final criteria for whether to send a kangaroo is that the message must be eight hours old. Yesterday I was initially planning for 2-hours old, but I decided to give myself more time to respond manually before the kangaroo would go out. Here\u0026rsquo;s the SQL for that:\n-- Message is 8 hours old: AND NOW() - to_timestamp(messenger.timestamp/1000) at time zone 'UTC' \u0026gt; INTERVAL '8 HOURS' AND NOW() - to_timestamp(messenger.timestamp/1000) at time zone 'UTC' \u0026lt; INTERVAL '8.25 HOURS'  Putting it all together Here\u0026rsquo;s the complete SQL query that finds messages which warrant an automated kangaroo response.\n-- Select the most recent message per thread -- (ignoring trivial messages from you), -- and the most recent message per thread specifically from me. -- If the most recent message (ignoring trivial messages from you) -- is non-trivial, -- written-by-you, -- not a reply to my message, -- and a specific age, -- then we've got ourselves a Kangaroo! -- -- In a future iteration we will also ensure the message has been read-by-me. SELECT * FROM -- The first sub-query: -- Selects the most recent message from each thread that is either: -- (A) from me, or (B) from you and non-trivial in length -- And is also less than 8 hours old. ((select thread_id, max(timestamp) as timestamp from messenger where (author = '1409114395' or (author \u0026lt;\u0026gt; '1409114395' and LENGTH(text) \u0026gt; 15)) -- and to_timestamp(timestamp/1000) at time zone 'UTC' \u0026gt; NOW() - INTERVAL '800 HOURS' group by thread_id) AS latest_messages INNER JOIN messenger ON messenger.thread_id = latest_messages.thread_id AND messenger.timestamp = latest_messages.timestamp) LEFT JOIN -- Selects the most recent message from each thread from me: (select thread_id, max(timestamp) as outgoing_timestamp from messenger where author = '1409114395' -- and to_timestamp(timestamp/1000) at time zone 'UTC' \u0026gt; NOW() - INTERVAL '800 HOURS' group by thread_id) AS latest_outgoing_messages ON messenger.thread_id = latest_outgoing_messages.thread_id WHERE messenger.author \u0026lt;\u0026gt; '1409114395' -- David Bieber AND messenger.author \u0026lt;\u0026gt; '1985867351654140' -- Bieber Bot AND ( -- The reply is at least X minutes after my latest message. (latest_messages.timestamp - outgoing_timestamp)/1000 \u0026gt; 36*60*60 or outgoing_timestamp IS NULL ) AND thread_type = 'USER' -- Message is a 1:1 chat, not a group chat -- Message is 8 hours old: AND NOW() - to_timestamp(messenger.timestamp/1000) at time zone 'UTC' \u0026gt; INTERVAL '8 HOURS' AND NOW() - to_timestamp(messenger.timestamp/1000) at time zone 'UTC' \u0026lt; INTERVAL '8.25 HOURS' ORDER BY messenger.timestamp desc;  This checks all the criteria for whether a message needs a kangaroo. I\u0026rsquo;ve set up a script that runs this query every ten minutes, and sends kangaroos as necessary.\nAt the time of this writing, no kangaroos have been sent yet.

We\u0026rsquo;ve got to get this right.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s disentangle what you get notified about, when you get notified about it, and where/how you\u0026rsquo;re notified. This leads us to a vision where users can define notification strategies and take control of their attention1.\nWhat to notify on (References and Queries) What do we want to get notified about? First, three scenarios to motivate our discussion. Then, the primitives: references and queries.\nScenario 1, Chat: You\u0026rsquo;re working on Secret Project X, conversing asynchronously with your teammate Abhay about Feature XX. It\u0026rsquo;s gonna be big. While you\u0026rsquo;re off working on something else Abhay responds to a bunch of your earlier messages. You want to get notified about this, for sure.\nScenario 2, Blockers: You\u0026rsquo;re working on Task A. But it\u0026rsquo;s blocked by Tasks B and C. You represent this in your Roam graph like this:\n(As an aside, being able to embed a tiny piece of my Roam graph in my blog would be super helpful.)\nOnce Task B and Task C are marked DONE, you want to get notified so you can resume working on Task A.\nScenario 3, Topic Tracking: You\u0026rsquo;re in a big multiplayer graph and you\u0026rsquo;ve carefully curated a page about your own project Python Fire. You\u0026rsquo;re excited when people talk about Fire, so you want notifications when people reference it.\nThe Primitives: References and Queries Basic usage: Notifications when someone responds to me2, notifications when someone references a particular page or block (linked or unlinked)\nAdvanced usage: Roam queries and Datalog queries3 are extremely expressive. I should be able to set up a query and get notified whenever the query results change.\nNow that we\u0026rsquo;ve set out what we want to get notified about, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about when we want to receive the notifications. We\u0026rsquo;ll get to how we want to configure the notifications a little bit later on.\nWhen to notify (Immediately, Batched, Delayed, At specific times?) Most apps have minimal options for when you receive notifications. A typical message board config offers \u0026ldquo;every individual email\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;daily digest\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;weekly digest.\u0026rdquo; This is Roam. We can do better than that.\nFor the messages from Abhay about Project XX, I want notifications to pop up immediately.\nWhen I become unblocked on a task, I want a notification within the hour, but if multiple tasks become unblocked they the notifications can totally be bundled. I don\u0026rsquo;t need an individual notification per task. That would just be overkill.\nAnd for references to Python Fire, a daily digest at 9am is more than sufficient.\nPrimitive: Notification Strategies Anyone with a bit of JavaScript or Clojure knowledge can define a notification strategy. A notification strategy defines the rules for how notifications should be handled. The interface for a notification strategy is: stream of notifications in, stream of notifications out.4\nBy allowing users to define and share notification strategies, we can empower uses to take back their attention and get more out of their Roam experience.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Notification strategies\u0026rdquo; approach benefits non-programmers too, because notification strategies can be shared in the Roam Depot5. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping for a future where RoamHacker and David Vargas and others have developed both simple and sophisticated \u0026ldquo;notification managers\u0026rdquo;: UIs where non-programmers can configure their notification settings in the level of detail best suited for them.\nPrimitive: Tags connect references and queries to notification strategies That is, tags connect what to when.\nWhen you write a notification strategy, you name it. Tag a reference of a query with the name of a notification strategy to run that strategy on that reference or query.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s clarify with an example.\nSay I have a query (\u0026ldquo;all Tasks with \u0026lsquo;Blockers\u0026rsquo; where all Blockers are \u0026lsquo;DONE\u0026rsquo;\u0026quot;), and a notification strategy named \u0026ldquo;Bundle on the Hour\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;bundle all incoming notifications and emit them on the hour as a single notification\u0026rdquo;). Then I can tag the query with #[[Bundle on the Hour]] to start applying that notification strategy to the results of the query.\nOnce I\u0026rsquo;ve added that tag, the notification strategy will be called every time the query results change, and it will be able to start emitting notifications.\nSimilarly if I write [[Python Fire]] and tag it with #[[Digest at 9am]], then that notification strategy will be called whenever the references to or contents of the Python Fire page change.\nWhere/How: Actually sending notifications Great, we\u0026rsquo;ve talked about how to decide what to notify about, and when to send the notifications. How/where do the notifications actually get sent?\nA sensible default for the first pass is to use browser notifications. But we\u0026rsquo;re thinking long term, so I won\u0026rsquo;t dwell on this \u0026ldquo;first pass\u0026rdquo; for too long.\nIf you do want to use browser notifications, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to do so6. You can try this in your Roam graph (or browser console7) right now:\nfunction notify(text) { // Let's check if the browser supports notifications if (!(\u0026quot;Notification\u0026quot; in window)) { alert(text); } // Let's check whether notification permissions have already been granted else if (Notification.permission === \u0026quot;granted\u0026quot;) { // If it's okay let's create a notification var notification = new Notification(text); } // Otherwise, we need to ask the user for permission else if (Notification.permission !== \u0026quot;denied\u0026quot;) { Notification.requestPermission().then(function (permission) { // If the user accepts, let's create a notification if (permission === \u0026quot;granted\u0026quot;) { var notification = new Notification(text); } else { console.log(text); } }); } else { // At last, if the user has denied notifications, and you // want to be respectful there is no need to bother them any more. console.log(text); } } notify(\u0026quot;You've got mail.\u0026quot;);  I don\u0026rsquo;t want browser notifications though. I want my personal digital assistant Bieber Bot to send me notifications. Now, this is no trouble in a private graph. I can use a webhook to send myself a message as Bieber Bot. In a public graph, however, this would be dangerous. Anyone could see the code and start impersonating Bieber Bot. A travesty!\nSo, we need Roam to support secrets. Ideally this would come from the Roam core team, not the community. First class secrets would enable me to write roam/js that communicates securely with my own services, like Bieber Bot and others, without giving other users the capability of doing the same.\nAs an alternative approach to secrets, having all Roam graphs be one giant graph with a good permissions model would also be sufficient. Then I could put my notifier code in my graph (private), but have the queries that trigger the notifier apply to a graph I share with my team.\nHow does specifying a notifier (browser notifications vs Bieber Bot) fit in with writing queries and enabling notifications? You can set your default \u0026ldquo;notify\u0026rdquo; function just by defining the function \u0026ldquo;notify\u0026rdquo; and tagging it / nesting it under roam/notify. You can also set a notify function whenever you define notifications just by adding an extra reference with the name of the notify function.\nSome Examples This was a lot, and reading the above it might sound complicated. And that\u0026rsquo;s because it can be complicated; you can have as complicated a notification strategy as you like. But it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be complicated, and for most users it won\u0026rsquo;t be.\nIdeally turning on notifications for messages could be as simple as adding a block in your graph that says:\n[[roam/messages]] #[[Notify me immediately]]\nTurning on notifications for unblocked tasks could be as simple as (1) getting the unblocked tasks query from the Roam Depot, and then (2) adding a block [[Unblocked tasks]] #[[Bundle on the Hour]].\nAnd turning on notifications for references to Python Fire should simply mean adding a block [[Python Fire]] #[[Digest at 9am]].\nLet\u0026rsquo;s build it Want to build this with me? I\u0026rsquo;m @Bieber on Twitter and active as dbieber on the Roam Slack.\n  And still provides sensible defaults and easy configs for non-power users. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n This one, while a basic use case, is actually tricky to express as a query. But we can do it, I\u0026rsquo;m confident. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n See my two snippets for lots of examples of what you can do with datalog queries. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n soni-sono for short. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Has anyone taken the Home Depot logo and replaced the word Home with Roam in the appropriate font yet? \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Code courtesy of MDN. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n cmd-option-i to open your browser console on Chrome on Mac.

Rather, this post is about an idea for a kind of \u0026ldquo;right now\u0026rdquo; page that I\u0026rsquo;m toying with building.\nI\u0026rsquo;d like to make a page that tells the reader if I\u0026rsquo;m likely available for a conversation right now. I\u0026rsquo;d call it the \u0026ldquo;is David available to talk now\u0026rdquo; page, and here\u0026rsquo;s how it might work.\nIt aims only to give a best guess as to whether I can talk now. It says No during work. It says No during sleep hours. It says No while I\u0026rsquo;m on a phone call / skype / zoom / meet etc It says No if I have recently been on a call for a long time\nIt says Yes during explicitly times (there would be a button I can press to set it to Yes for 30 minutes)\nIf I\u0026rsquo;m deliberately in a public space (e.g. Gather Town, Clubhouse) AND looking for conversation (aka I\u0026rsquo;ve pushed the button), then it shows where to find me.\nAnd the rest of the time, it simply shrugs.\nWhy would I want such a system? Well, what I really want is for everyone to use such a system. I want the \u0026ldquo;open door\u0026rdquo; system that professors so often use; if my door is open, you\u0026rsquo;re welcome to come in and talk. I want to avoid people avoiding saying hi because they don\u0026rsquo;t know if I\u0026rsquo;m available. And I want to avoid the mental overhead of making plans for conversations that aren\u0026rsquo;t time sensitive. Plans are tough.\nMy ideal system for when I want to talk to someone isn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;let\u0026rsquo;s pick a time to talk\u0026rdquo;, because that has scheduling overhead and will likely break up my day at an inconvenient time. Instead, I\u0026rsquo;d prefer a more flexible approach. When I\u0026rsquo;m free, I open my door (a digital, virtual, door). I send you a message that I\u0026rsquo;d like to talk; you see it when you\u0026rsquo;re free (because you have notifications disabled 👍). If I\u0026rsquo;m still free then, my door will still be open and we can talk. If I\u0026rsquo;ve moved on to another activity, my door will be closed and we\u0026rsquo;ll reconnect later.\nIn the absence of doors, the \u0026ldquo;is David available to talk now\u0026rdquo; page is my idea for an approximation.\nBut I don\u0026rsquo;t know yet how I would build it. The idea requires programmatically determining when I\u0026rsquo;ve been on the phone, in skype, in zoom, etc. I haven\u0026rsquo;t looking into how approachable these services are to work with. And I likely wont. This is the sort of idea that, while fun to entertain, will likely need to morph considerably before it turns into a real project. Such is the nature of the Snippet.\n","date":1611273600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611273600,"objectID":"872401f3b514d37e6ac5759b850d7506","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-22-am-i-available-for-conversation-right-now-dot-com/","publishdate":"2021-01-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2021-01-22-am-i-available-for-conversation-right-now-dot-com/","section":"snippets","summary":"I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I like this idea, but I\u0026rsquo;m giving it a try; I\u0026rsquo;ve added a \u0026ldquo;Now\u0026rdquo; page to my website ( davidbieber.com/now).\nThe idea for now pages is described at https://nownownow.com/about.\nBasically, a now page says what\u0026rsquo;s going on in the author\u0026rsquo;s life now.

The experiment lasts for two weeks, and requires only a small time commitment during this period (just a few hours total). During these two weeks, you will learn about several topics, and you will also teach the group about one or two topics yourself. The first peer learning group session will be January 25 - February 7, 2021. If this interests you, I encourage you to sign up here. Additional details about \u0026ldquo;how it works\u0026rdquo; below the fold.\nLoading… How it works On January 25, everyone will be added to a Facebook Messenger group chat. I\u0026rsquo;m targeting a group of about 6-8 people.\nBehind the scenes, I will be contacting everyone to learn what they are interested in learning about. I\u0026rsquo;ll coordinate with you to figure out 1 or 2 topics for you to teach the group about. These will be topics that someone else in the group is interested in. We\u0026rsquo;ll also select a day for you to do the learning and teaching.\nOn the chosen day, you\u0026rsquo;ll be expected to spend about an hour learning about the selected topic, and sharing what you learn with the group chat. (You\u0026rsquo;re welcome to learn about the topic in advance, but that\u0026rsquo;s not required!)\nHow you share what you\u0026rsquo;ve learned with the group is up to you, but the bar is low. There\u0026rsquo;s no expectation of putting together a lesson plan. Instead, I\u0026rsquo;m envisioning you \u0026ldquo;live tweeting\u0026rdquo; interesting things as you learn them, putting quotes, images, and explanations into the chat that you think communicate the main ideas clearly. But I\u0026rsquo;ll reiterate: how you share what you\u0026rsquo;ve learned is completely up to you, and we\u0026rsquo;re setting our expectations low.\nEveryone else is welcome to discuss, ask questions, share insights, etc. The chat is there for you to use how you please.\nSince an hour is a relatively short period of time, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to allocate topics to you that are at the fringes of your expertise already. My theory is that while an hour is fairly short, it will still be really rewarding to hear what someone else learns from a concentrated hour of study.\nAt the end of the two week period, you\u0026rsquo;ll have \u0026ldquo;presented\u0026rdquo; once or twice, and collectively we\u0026rsquo;ll have learned about ~10 different topics in total.\nThe goal is to meet people and learn new things, and also to have fun.

If you haven\u0026rsquo;t yet, read that first. Today, we\u0026rsquo;re going to be looking at its strengths and limitations.\nStrengths People can choose which issues matter most to them. If an issue matters to you, you can vote on it directly. And so can all the people you convince to support your cause. You can do this even if your representatives disagree with you.\nRepresentatives don\u0026rsquo;t need to be experts on everything. If an issue is highly technical, representatives can delegate their constituents' votes to someone who is a subject matter expert with similar values to the representative. If a voter doesn\u0026rsquo;t like the choice, they can make a different choice.\nResidents don\u0026rsquo;t need to be experts on everything. For most issues, most voters will delegate their votes to a Delegate. Residents can choose how much or how little time they want to spend researching individual issues.\nResidents don\u0026rsquo;t need to trust their representatives for multiple years. If a resident disagrees with their representative on even a single issue, they can make their vote and their voice count for that issue. They\u0026rsquo;re not stuck with a representative that only half represents them.\nPower propagates to those who are trusted. If people don\u0026rsquo;t like the way you\u0026rsquo;re voting, they can delegate their votes elsewhere. So, in order for a Delegate to keep their power, they need to keep the trust of their constituents.\nThe system can be implemented incrementally, even for as little as a single issue. It can be implemented incrementally on top of existing forms of governance such as the US government. Democratic Delegation-optional Voting doesn\u0026rsquo;t require explicit elected representatives for matters that require voting (elected representatives have other important responsibilities, so they aren\u0026rsquo;t going away entirely with this system!)\nDDoV can be used whenever the population of voters is well defined. This makes it well suited both for running states and country legislatures, and for running school government or Prom Royalty elections.\nThe system is compatible with many existing forms of voting. It works well with winner-take-all voting, ranked choice voting, approval voting, and proportional representation systems, for example.\nLimitations DDoV requires a mechanism for Delegate\u0026rsquo;s votes to be made public. This isn\u0026rsquo;t so hard to do, but it does need to be done in a timely manner in order to give people the opportunity to change their vote in the 48 hour period following the election deadline.\nA poor implementation could be prone to abuse of power by small Delegates. How could this happen? If Delegates know how many ballots have been delegated to them, then a small Delegate could figure out whether or not a particular individual has delegated their votes to them. Of course, pressuring someone to delegate their vote to you is against the rules, but in many cases this would be hard to detect or enforce. To avoid this issue, a signature requirement (e.g. of 10 signatures from supporters who would use you as a default Delegate) could be required to become a Delegate. Once there\u0026rsquo;s this modest amount of public support for someone to become a Delegate, it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be possible for a Delegate to determine if an individual is delegating votes to them or not. Alternatively, information about how many ballots each Delegate has delegated to them could be only provided in an approximate form.\nReduces the capacity for backroom deals and compromises. Okay, so this might actually be a strength. Since power is more in the hands of the people, it becomes far more difficult for one party to exchange favors with another (\u0026ldquo;if you support xyz in bill A, I\u0026rsquo;ll support qrs in bill B.\u0026quot;) I think this strength and/or limitation requires further study.\n","date":1610409600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610409600,"objectID":"2e766e1100cd12119d75ddb65c56626c","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-12-limitations-of-democratic-delegation-optional-voting/","publishdate":"2021-01-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2021-01-12-limitations-of-democratic-delegation-optional-voting/","section":"snippets","summary":"In yesterday\u0026rsquo;s snippet I introduced the idea of democratic delegation-optional voting.

The core idea of the voting system is that anyone can choose to delegate their vote to a group or individual that they trust. They may change their delegate selection at any time and for any reason (including for a brief period after votes are cast, as we will see), or they may choose to cast a vote themselves rather than delegating their vote.\nWhat problem does this voting system solve? Individual voters don\u0026rsquo;t have enough time or energy to research every issue up for vote. So, delegation is crucial. At the same time, voters shouldn\u0026rsquo;t yield their power to delegates entirely. If a voter feels passionately about an issue, they should not have to hope their representative\u0026rsquo;s views align with theirs.\nHow does the system work? Ahead of a Vote, an individual or organization can register themselves as a Delegate. They need only do this once even if there will be many Votes.\nOn its own, a Delegate has no voting power. Each voter gets one ballot. Each voter may choose to cast that ballot themselves, or they may delegate their ballot to a Delegate.\nSimilarly, a Delegate may choose to cast its ballots itself, or it may choose to delegate them to another Delegate. If ten people have delegated their ballots to a Delegate, then it has ten times the voting power of an individual. A Delegate\u0026rsquo;s votes or delegation selections are public, whereas an individual\u0026rsquo;s votes or delegation selections are private.\nVotes may be cast or a Delegate selected at any time leading up to a Vote deadline. Votes may be modified and Delegate selections may be changed up until this deadline.\nOnce the Vote deadline arrives, votes and delegation-selections made by Delegates are made public. Delegates can no longer change their selections at this point. Individual voters then have an additional 48 hours following the Vote deadline during which they may choose to modify their ballot.\nThe system is flexible, in that it is compatible with winner-take-all voting, ranked choice voting, approval voting, proportional representation, etc.\nToy Example: Playground Election We now demonstrate the voting system in a playground setting.\nAaron, Brianna, Chloe, Daniel, and Emily are playing on the playground. Aaron and Brianna both want to use the swing. There\u0026rsquo;s only one swing. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s vote!\u0026rdquo; suggests Emily. \u0026ldquo;Whoever gets more votes gets to swing.\u0026rdquo; Aaron and Brianna agree: whoever gets three or more votes wins. Daniel shrugs. \u0026ldquo;Chloe can have my vote!\u0026rdquo; he shouts, and he runs off to play alone on the seesaw.\nSo Aaron, Brianna, Chloe and Emily each vote: Aaron and Brianna each for themselves, Chloe for Aaron and Emily for Brianna.\n\u0026ldquo;So Aaron wins, 3-2, since Chloe\u0026rsquo;s vote also counts for Daniel!\u0026rdquo; Emily shouts. She\u0026rsquo;s really getting into this election thing.\nJust then Daniel comes tearing around the corner. \u0026ldquo;Wait! I thought you were going to vote for Brianna\u0026rdquo;, he tells Chloe. \u0026ldquo;Can I change my vote?\u0026rdquo;\nEmily, having studied Democratic Delegation-optional Voting says \u0026ldquo;Sure, no trouble. Anyone else?\u0026rdquo; Hearing no other vote-changes, she proclaims Brianna the winner, and Aaron spends the rest of recess helping push Brianna higher on the swing.\nAnother Example: Local and State Legislation For this example, consider a hypothetical local government and state government both using Democratic Delegation-optional Voting. Over the next two weeks, the local government will be voting on two issues (the school budget and a commercial cannabis restriction ordinance), and the state government will also be voting on two issues (an unpopular jaywalking penalty and an obscure contract law thingy that affects very few people and is hard to understand).\nMany of the residents have set up simple rules for choosing default Delegates. Several republican residents, they have selected their local republican Delegate as their default Delegate, and similarly several democratic residents have selected the local democratic Delegate as their default Delegate. Some residents have a rule-based system, where e.g. education-related issues are delegated to one Delegate while penal code issues are delegated to another.\nThe Vote deadlines are set as follows, and the text of each issue is made available to the public two weeks prior to its Vote deadline:\nLocal school budget: January 21, 2021\nState unpopular jaywalking penalty: January 22, 2021\nLocal commercial cannabis restriction ordinance: January 28, 2021\nState obscure contract law thingy that affects very few people and is hard to understand: January 29, 2021\nMany of the residents hear about the unpopular jaywalking penalty, and they see how awful an idea it is, and so they directly submit a Nay vote on that issue. The penalty is overwhelmingly voted down.\nThe school budget is a popular but particularly nuanced issue. While many residents chose to vote on it directly, we also see many residents choose a Delegate that they trust with school board issues, since they know this vote is important but complicated.\nFor many people, the commercial cannabis restriction ordinance is an important issue too, but they trust their default Delegate will vote appropriately. The day after the election they\u0026rsquo;re surprised to read on their social media newsfeed of choice that one of the common default Delegates didn\u0026rsquo;t vote as expected, so they double check their vote. The vote looks fine. Clickbait post, I guess.\nMany of the residents don\u0026rsquo;t care about the obscure contract law thingy that affects very few people and is hard to understand, and so they leave their default Delegate selected. Some of the common default Delegates also don\u0026rsquo;t have time for obscure contract law, and so they choose to delegate their votes to still further, more specialized Delegates that they trust. (This is good because not only do most voters not have time to look into contract law, they also don\u0026rsquo;t have time to look into people who do have time to look into contract law, so they trust their Delegate to do that.) Most of the voters are fine with how their vote ends up being cast, though a few don\u0026rsquo;t like the sub-Delegate their default-Delegate chose, and so those few can change their vote if they like.\nIn all cases, the final votes are in and the election is tallied 48 hours after the election deadline. The school budget passes. The jaywalking penalty is voted down. The commercial cannabis restriction ordinance will go into effect immediately. And the obscure contract law thingy that affects very few people and is hard to understand\u0026hellip; well, to be honest I didn\u0026rsquo;t really follow that one too closely.\nSome observations You\u0026rsquo;ve seen the Democratic Delegation-optional Voting in action now. It\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;democratic\u0026rdquo;, because it gives everyone an equal voice in every election. Everyone gets precisely one vote. It\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;delegation-optional\u0026rdquo; because voters and Delegates alike have the choice of whether to vote directly, delegate their vote, or even skip voting altogether.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll notice that there are no explicit elected representatives in this system. There are merely different degrees of being an elected representative (the number of ballots you are responsible for as a Delegate). Anyone can register as a Delegate, and whether you make this a full-time job, investigating every single issue on the table, or whether you often delegate your votes further is up to you as a Delegate. Under this system, some common Delegates will be responsible for casting huge numbers of votes, while other Delegates will be responsible for casting just a handful.\nI mentioned that either an individual or an organization can register as a Delegate. If an organization registers as a Delegate they can select their votes through whatever process they choose (e.g. an internal election is fair game), and they are held to the same deadlines as every other Delegate.\nSome edge-cases and minor details As mentioned in the Local and State Legislation example, a voter can set up simple rules for selecting their default Delegate. The voting system can also be extended to allow a voter to additionally specify \u0026ldquo;fall-through\u0026rdquo; backup Delegates. A ballot is given to a fall-through Delegate in the case that a voter\u0026rsquo;s higher-priority Delegate does not take an action on a particular piece of legislation.\nWhat happens if a major Delegate delegates their ballots to a trusted specialized delegate, but isn\u0026rsquo;t happy with how that trusted specialized delegate votes? They can contact their constituents and let them know. The constituents will have 48 hours during which they can change their vote.\nWhat happens if a Delegate A delegates their ballots to Delegate B, and Delegate B delegates their ballots to Delegate A? This should be easy to avoid in practice, because I expect Delegates will naturally have clear roles / specializations. Should it occur, however, no vote will be cast for voters delegating their ballot to those Delegates (unless a voter listed a backup Delegate), and the voters will have the usual 48 hours during which to place their vote.\nConclusion Democratic Delegation-optional Voting truly puts governance in the hands of the people, without needing everyone to be an expert on everything. It makes Delegates accountable to their constituents, because a constituent can change their Delegates at any time. It allows people to perform their civic duty to precisely the extent that is appropriate for them. On the issues that matter most to them, they can cast an explicit vote. For the majority of issues, though, individuals don\u0026rsquo;t need to learn the details of every piece of legislation. They have the option to trust those to their Delegates.\n","date":1610323200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610323200,"objectID":"ca9fd363cb829336535061b5823b7471","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-11-democratic-delegation-optional-voting/","publishdate":"2021-01-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2021-01-11-democratic-delegation-optional-voting/","section":"snippets","summary":"In this snippet I propose a novel voting system, which I call \u0026ldquo;Democratic Delegation-optional Voting\u0026rdquo;.

Then if you ls the mounted directory, you can see each of the places you can read from and write to on social media.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a directory full of your chat threads. The timestamps indicate when they were created and when they were most recently modified. You can read the contents of the chat, or send a new message just as easily (and via the same tools) as you would write a file to disk.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a directory of all the Facebook posts made by all your friends and all the groups you follow. Each post has a file with its contents, and also one with all the comments and reactions to it. You can make a new post or add a new comment the same way you\u0026rsquo;d make a new file.\nYou can use standard tools for monitoring for new content. I like to use Python\u0026rsquo;s watchdog for this.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a directory for ads too, which you\u0026rsquo;re welcome to peruse or delete as you see fit.\nReacting to a twitter post, sending a DM, receiving discord or slack or signal messages\u0026hellip; all of these are organized as files and folders, and actions can be performed simply through file reads and writes.\nI\u0026rsquo;d sure love to use a filesystem like this, and Bieber Bot would too.\n","date":1610236800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610236800,"objectID":"b0a27c8eb08a59670d9f8890d20460da","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-10-a-filesystem-for-social-media/","publishdate":"2021-01-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2021-01-10-a-filesystem-for-social-media/","section":"snippets","summary":"Omar Riswan has an excellent project called TabFS that takes your browser tabs and exposes them to you as a filesystem.

It runs on my laptop and monitors my phone for when I visit distracting websites. I give it a list of distracting websites for it to keep an eye out for. My list is: twitter, facebook, hacker news, google news, reddit, and youtube.\nI can set it to perform some action whenever I\u0026rsquo;m on one of these websites. For this first iteration, I\u0026rsquo;m having Bieber Bot message me whenever it notices I\u0026rsquo;m on one of these websites. Now that it\u0026rsquo;s working though, it will be easy to customize to my liking.\nIn future iterations, I\u0026rsquo;ll have it wait until I\u0026rsquo;ve been spending several minutes on the website before messaging me, and I\u0026rsquo;ll only have it do this during times when I mean to be focused.\nWhy is this interesting? There are excellent browser extensions that help you take control of your browsing habits on your computer. I recommend DK\u0026rsquo;s Intention for this. However, there aren\u0026rsquo;t great solutions like Intention for mobile browsing.\nThe challenge is that mobile browsers don\u0026rsquo;t provide good ways for developers to write extensions. I\u0026rsquo;ve built my mobile distraction detector in spite of this limitation :).\nHow does it work? I use an iPhone and the Chrome browser. I\u0026rsquo;m logged into my Google Account on Chrome on both my phone and my laptop, and I have tab syncing turned on. With tab syncing, all my tab sessions from my phone are synced to my Google account, and are visible on my laptop, usually with a sub-minute latency. You can view this data in human-readable form at chrome://history/syncedTabs.\nThe tab session data is stored along with the rest of my Chrome data. Since I use a Mac, the path is ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Google/Chrome/Profile\\ 1/Sync\\ Data/LevelDB/. Note that \u0026ldquo;Profile 1\u0026rdquo; may be replaced with either \u0026ldquo;Default\u0026rdquo;, or the name of your Profile, depending on how many Google accounts you have connected with Chrome.\nThe data is stored in a LevelDB database (this is unusual for Chrome; most of the rest of your Chrome data is stored in sqlite3 databases). LevelDB is an efficient key-value store, which was written by Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat back in 2011. The keys which contain the synced tab data are those prefixed with \u0026ldquo;session-dt\u0026rdquo;. The corresponding values are SessionSpecifics protocol buffers. The protocol buffer definition is available here.\nBefore parsing the sync data, I always make a copy of it first, and then I only ever open the copy. This ensures that Chrome doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a lock on the database, and isn\u0026rsquo;t editing it concurrently with my own program reading it.\nI use the Python library plyvel to parse the LevelDB database: db = plyvel.DB(path_to_copy_of_leveldb_directory).\nIn order to use the protobuf definition, I compiled it first with protoc: protoc -I chromium/ chromium/components/sync/protocol/*.proto --python_out=dbieber/distraction_detection/\nPutting these pieces together, accessing the session data looks like this:\nimport plyvel from components.sync.protocol import session_specifics_pb2 db = plyvel.DB(path) for key, value in db.iterator(): if b'sessions-dt' in key: session = session_specifics_pb2.SessionSpecifics.FromString(value) db.close()  From here, the key remaining piece to understand is how to figure out which tabs are open on which devices.\nEach of the SessionSpecifics protos has an attribute: session_tag which uniquely identifies a session. For each session_tag, there is a single SessionSpecifics proto with a client_name attribute: this indicates which device the session lives on. Each of the remaining SessionSpecifics protos with that same tag correspond to a single tab, and the currently open URL for that tab comes from session.tab.navigation[-1].virtual_url.\nFrom there, it\u0026rsquo;s just a matter of matching the URLs against my list of distracting websites, and sending the data off to Bieber Bot. Distractions, detected. :D\nWhat next? I\u0026rsquo;ll tweak my own distraction detection setup to something that makes sense for me. Instead of immediate messages from Bieber Bot, I\u0026rsquo;ll have him try to keep my total senseless scrolling for a day to a moderate amount. I\u0026rsquo;ll have him be particularly vigilant about helping me keep my morning scrolling from going on too long.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll also send this snippet around to folks interested in building similar tools. While I won\u0026rsquo;t be turning this into a product for the masses, I\u0026rsquo;m hopeful that the method does get picked up by projects like Intention, ActivityWatch, and other tools that aim to help people maintain healthy browsing habits.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s common knowledge that with account syncing, rich data about your mobile browsing is available on your computer. So today, there isn\u0026rsquo;t much tooling that takes advantage of this. If you work on a product in this space, well, now you\u0026rsquo;ve had a glimpse of what data\u0026rsquo;s available and what it can do.

Instead, I have been writing \u0026ldquo;snippets,\u0026rdquo; which you can read here.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re going to read just one snippet, I recommend that it be this one. The main idea behind snippets is to allow me to write without the inhibitions I sometimes experience when writing a blog post for publication. By writing in a secluded section of the website with no (now, few) inbound links, and by deliberately keeping the quality bar for publication low to non-existent, I made it easier for myself to write often.\nTo keep the quality bar low, sometimes I would deliberately post a short half-baked thought, possibly without editing or revision. Despite this aim of keeping the quality bar low, and despite explicitly writing for no one, I often would find myself pleased with what I had written and eager for someone else to read it.\nTo me, this is the beauty of the setup. The (lack of) quality standards make starting writing easy. I typically start writing a snippet with the mindset that I have a little idea I want to get out of my head and onto paper. As I begin, I think it\u0026rsquo;s a small idea that will take just a few lines. Perhaps in the back of my mind I even think it will contribute to lowering of the quality-bar for the section of the website. And sometimes it does. But just as often, I find myself ready to elaborate on the idea. Perhaps I explain where the idea came from, or why I find it interesting. And by the time I\u0026rsquo;ve finished writing, I have a snippet that I\u0026rsquo;m proud of, and which I would love to discuss.\nThis is why I sometimes put my email address at the end of a snippet. With just a cursory description of the snippets section (\u0026ldquo;a place to write for no audience\u0026rdquo;), seeing my contact info at the end of a post may feel contradictory. Now you see that it is not; the lack of a quality bar and the lack of an audience serve their purpose in allowing me to start writing easily, and to publish readily, but once I have written something and released it to (a tiny unlinked corner of) the world I do not necessarily want to keep it hidden.\nSo, I am now for the first time linking from my main website directly to the snippets section of my website. It\u0026rsquo;s not a prominent link, as it\u0026rsquo;s contained only within this blog post, but it\u0026rsquo;s a meaningful step for me. Web crawlers now have a means in to index the site. Visitors to the site now have a means in too, not just people to whom I explicitly send the link.\nIf you do venture in, and read a snippet or two, there are a few things to know. First, you\u0026rsquo;re welcome here. It\u0026rsquo;s not voyeurism. These aren\u0026rsquo;t private posts; they\u0026rsquo;re simply not written for an audience, but I am happy for them to have one. Second, they\u0026rsquo;re snippets. Think of them like ideas scrawled in a hurry. I\u0026rsquo;m not wedded to the ideas I express, and I\u0026rsquo;m open to reconsidering what I wrote. And thirdly, I value your thoughts (and your time!), and it would delight me to hear them.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll find ideas for side-projects, philosophical musings, technical notes meant mainly for future-me, technical notes meant for other people, project updates, nonsense, personal notes, and more.

This snippet comes from my answers.\n Question: Do you think a person has a hypothesis space and prior that are fixed at the moment of birth and never change over the course of the person\u0026rsquo;s life?\n tl;dr Nope.\nThere are different levels at which you can define hypothesis space. Consider two statements.\n Statement [1]: People learn and change their prior over hypotheses based on their observations and experiences over time.\n In statement [1] (which I hope is unobjectionably true), \u0026ldquo;hypotheses\u0026rdquo; refers to hypotheses that will be formed during a person\u0026rsquo;s life.\nA person\u0026rsquo;s belief about their hypotheses can change in response to new information. This can be done in a Bayesian way, using as a prior at any particular moment their beliefs from before gaining that new information. When they gain new information, they apply Bayesian inference to compute the posterior. The posterior becomes the new prior for the next time new information is obtained.\nYou can also \u0026ldquo;refactor\u0026rdquo; statement [1] to instead read:\n Statement [2]: The \u0026lsquo;computation that a person embodies\u0026rsquo; is fixed at birth.\u0026quot;\n [1] and [2] are completely consistent with one another.\n(Let me know if the term \u0026lsquo;computation that a person embodies\u0026rsquo; needs clarifying.)\nFrom the perspective of [2], a person has a single prior over \u0026ldquo;hypotheses\u0026rdquo;.\n(Or more precisely: a person has a single \u0026ldquo;hypothesis\u0026rdquo;, which came from a single prior. But the person didn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026lsquo;have\u0026rsquo; that prior; instead, the process by which they were created did.)\nHere a \u0026ldquo;hypothesis\u0026rdquo; is a much larger thing than in [1]. It\u0026rsquo;s the complete manner in which the person will determine how to respond to inputs over the course of their life. (That is, it\u0026rsquo;s the \u0026lsquo;computation that the person embodies\u0026rsquo;.)\nIt\u0026rsquo;s an interesting question to ask whether these hypotheses come from something that approximates Solomonoff induction.\nNote that this wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the \u0026ldquo;brain approximating Solomonoff induction\u0026rdquo; original question \u0026ndash; rather, it would be more like \u0026ldquo;evolution approximating Solomonoff induction\u0026rdquo;.\n[Aside: And to answer this question: I don\u0026rsquo;t think single reward minimization is the most natural way to model what these complex physical processes are doing; there are lots of competing forces at play. So even though you could in principle distill them to a single reward function, I don\u0026rsquo;t think that\u0026rsquo;s the most useful way of modeling things of this complexity and scale. Update: now that I have a better understanding of Solomonoff induction, I see how this doesn\u0026rsquo;t answer the question.]\n If the answer to the main question is No, there needs to be an extra-Bayesian method for choosing priors and hypothesis spaces.\n I agree with this.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s return to perspective [1]. At any given time, a person might have some beliefs about the world. Then they acquire new information. They update their beliefs. This in principle can be done in a Bayesian way all throughout ones life.\nIn practice, there need to be other processes at work, because people develop new concepts, choose to think about some things more than others, forget stuff, etc.\nBut with infinite memory and infinitely fast compute, an agent could in principle start with all possible concepts, and just keep doing Bayesian updates throughout their life, and I think such an agent would do quite well for themselves.\nNote: for a hypothetical agent like this, the answer to the original question would be Yes. But agents like this don\u0026rsquo;t exist.\n Agree or disagree: The brain samples hypotheses from a universal unchanging prior.\n This I disagree with. I hope perspective [1] clarifies why.\nAny action that the brain takes, such as sampling a hypothesis, is happening during an individual\u0026rsquo;s life. Of course it\u0026rsquo;s going to take into account all the experiences of the individual.\nYou could of course mean \u0026ldquo;hypothesis\u0026rdquo; in the sense of [2], where the complete life experiences of the individual are inputs to the hypothesis. But then why wait until there\u0026rsquo;s a brain at all to sample the hypothesis? Now we\u0026rsquo;re talking about a hypothesis (the \u0026lsquo;computation that the person embodies\u0026rsquo;) that has been in existence at least since the person\u0026rsquo;s birth.\n Do you think [1] and [2] are equivalent?\n I think they are two ways of describing the same situation. So, in that sense, yes.\nI could see why people might disagree with this though. People can make good arguments that you\u0026rsquo;re not just a fixed embodied computation. I think these arguments are wrong, but people can still make them. These hypothetical people would regard [1] as correct and [2] as incorrect, whereas I think both [1] and [2] are correct.\n Bayesian inference doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide a way to create or destroy hypotheses. It merely provides a way for updating one\u0026rsquo;s beliefs about existing hypotheses. How do you reconcile this with [1] and [2]?\n This is right. Hypotheses can\u0026rsquo;t be \u0026ldquo;formed\u0026rdquo; from Bayesian inference. As I was describing perspective [1], I was envisioning hypotheses being formed in some (likely extra-Bayesian, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t important) way and merely being updated via Bayesian inference.\n[Aside: How are these hypotheses formed though?\nWell, if you already have a prior for the state of the universe, then you might (1) make a determination about what variables are relevant to the situation, and (2) marginalize out all other variables. No need to do this though if memory and compute aren\u0026rsquo;t limited.]\nEarlier I wrote:\n Let\u0026rsquo;s return to perspective [1]. At any given time, a person might have some beliefs about the world. Then they acquire new information. They update their beliefs. This in principle can be done in a Bayesian way all throughout ones life.\n How does this work, you ask?\nIt relies on the agent starting with a prior over all possible hypotheses. This avoids the issue of needing to create hypotheses along the way, which Bayesian inference doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide a mechanism for.\nI tried to describe this by the following text:\n With infinite memory and infinitely fast compute, an agent could in principle start with all possible concepts, and just keep doing Bayesian updates throughout their life, and I think such an agent would do quite well for themselves.\n If I understand correctly, this is (more or less) Solomonoff induction. (I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize this at the start of the conversation.)\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve started with a universal prior and applied bayesian inference to update it as we made observations.\nOf course, this isn\u0026rsquo;t what people do.

This post describes mine. I was inspired to start this two months ago by reading Nicky Case\u0026rsquo;s comic on spaced repetition, and I highly recommend the read.\n\u0026ldquo;Spaced repetition\u0026rdquo; just means studying flashcards, studying the cards you know best less often, and study the cards you struggle with more often. It\u0026rsquo;s a powerful technique for learning and remembering material, whether you\u0026rsquo;re a student or a lifelong learner.\nThe system I use is based on a classic system called the \u0026ldquo;Leitner Box\u0026rdquo; method. I\u0026rsquo;ll first describe how to use the \u0026ldquo;Leitner Box\u0026rdquo; approach in Roam, and then I\u0026rsquo;ll describe the adjustments I made to improve it.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s a \u0026ldquo;Leitner Box\u0026rdquo;? In the \u0026ldquo;Leitner Box\u0026rdquo; system of spaced repetition, there are seven boxes numbered Box 1 through Box 7. When you create a flashcard, you place it into Box 1. Every day, you use a schedule to determine which boxes of cards to review. The cards in box 1 get reviewed most often, and the cards in box 7 get reviewed least often. When you review a card, you move it up a box (e.g. from box 1 to 2 or from box 4 to 5) if you get the card right. But if you get a card wrong, you move the card back to box 1.\nThe default Leitner Box schedule looks like this:\nHow do you read this schedule?\nThe colored circles represent the different Leitner Boxes. The red circles represent Box 1, the orange circles represent Box 2, the yellow circles represent Box 3, all the way up to the final pink circle that represents Box 7.\nThe numbers along the bottom are \u0026ldquo;session numbers\u0026rdquo;. For your first review session, you look at the circles above \u0026ldquo;01\u0026rdquo; (Boxes 2 and 1). For your second review session, you look at the circles above \u0026ldquo;02\u0026rdquo; (Boxes 3 and 1). Always review boxes for a given day in order from highest to lowest. After completing session \u0026ldquo;64\u0026rdquo;, the schedule wraps around and your next session is session \u0026ldquo;01\u0026rdquo; again.\nTo recap, (1) you put new flashcards into Box 1. (2) When you get a card correct, you move it up a box. (3) When you get a card incorrect, you move it all the way back to Box 1. (4) You use the schedule made of colored dots to decide which boxes to review each day, answering questions in higher boxes first.\nSetting up Leitner Boxes in Roam This system is all well and good. How do we put it into practice? Here I\u0026rsquo;ll quickly describe (1) getting set up, (2) creating new flashcards, and (3) how to do a review session.\nSetting up: You can use my template; simply copy and paste the \u0026ldquo;raw\u0026rdquo; text at the bottom of the page here into Roam Research, e.g. onto a new page named \u0026ldquo;Spaced Repetition\u0026rdquo;. For this to work you need to copy from the region that says \u0026ldquo;RAW paste data\u0026rdquo;. You can get the enhanced template (recommended; see below) here. Again, be sure to copy from the region that says \u0026ldquo;RAW paste data\u0026rdquo;.\nThe default template creates a page for each of the seven Leitner boxes. It also puts the default schedule on the page, and gives you a place to keep track of what session number you\u0026rsquo;re up to. It will also add two questions to your Leitner Box 1 (one about avocados, and one about Cloze deletions), and includes some basic instructions for how to do spaced repetition in Roam.\nCreating New Flashcards: You can create a new card anywhere in your Roam graph simply by tagging a note with \u0026ldquo;#[[Leitner Box 1]]\u0026rdquo;. Here are two ways to create cards in Roam:\n  Put the question on one bullet, and put the answer in the child bullets. Then tag the bullet with the question with \u0026ldquo;#[[Leitner Box 1]]\u0026rdquo; to add it to your spaced repetition system.\n  You can use the syntax {{=: question | answer}} in Roam to create text that remains hidden until clicked. The text \u0026ldquo;answer\u0026rdquo; wont appear until you click on the text \u0026ldquo;question.\u0026rdquo; Again, tag the line with \u0026ldquo;#[[Leitner Box 1]]\u0026rdquo; to add it to your spaced repetition system.\n  I recommend you read Andy Matuschak\u0026rsquo;s notes on \u0026ldquo;How to write good prompts\u0026rdquo; for tips on how to create good flashcards. Nicky Case\u0026rsquo;s comic: \u0026ldquo;How to Remember Anything Forever-ish\u0026rdquo; also has good suggestions for how to create good questions for spaced repetition.\nHow to do a Review Session: Visit your \u0026ldquo;Spaced Repetition\u0026rdquo; page to figure out what session number to do. Increment the session number, and use the schedule to determine which Leitner boxes you\u0026rsquo;ll be looking at in this session. Remember, do the Leitner boxes in decreasing order of their number.\nFor each Leitner box, visit its page in Roam. All your questions will appear in the Linked References section of the page.\nGo through the questions one by one. If you get the answer correct, increment the box number by 1. If you get the answer incorrect or struggle with it, set the tag back to \u0026ldquo;#[[Leitner Box 1]]\u0026rdquo;.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t worry about sending things back to box 1; you\u0026rsquo;ll see those questions very often and soon they\u0026rsquo;ll be back in the higher numbered boxes again!\nEnhancements Beyond the Default System I\u0026rsquo;ve made several changes to the default Leitner Box system to improve it to my taste. You\u0026rsquo;re welcome to use them!\nLeitner Boxes 0 and $\\infty$: I use an extra box, \u0026ldquo;Leitner Box 0\u0026rdquo; for flashcards that I\u0026rsquo;m not ready to put into my rotation yet. I try to only add at most 10 cards a day to keep the total review workload low. If I have more cards than this, I keep them in Box 0 until I\u0026rsquo;m ready to start studying them, at which point I move them to Box 1.\nLeitner Box $\\infty$ is for cards that have graduated from Box 7. In theory, I will remember these cards for the rest of my life.\nExtra box 5s, 6s, and 7s: I have decided to create two Box 5s (named 5A and 5B), four Box 6s (6A, 6B, 6C, and 6D), and eight Box 7s (7A through 7H). This prevents any individual review session from accumulating too many cards.\nI ran a simulation and under the default system, adding 10 new cards a day and getting 95% of cards correct, some review sessions will require reviewing over 700 cards! Under the enhanced system, the longest review session will only ever be 140 cards (and most review sessions are much shorter than that).\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the modified schedule that allows me to use these extra boxes:\nTo use this enhanced schedule, first use the review session number to figure out which column of colored circles to look at. As before, a red circle indicates Leitner Box 1, a yellow circle indicates Leitner Box 2, etc. If the circle has a letter inside it, that means to review that particular variant of the box. E.g. a blue circle with a \u0026ldquo;B\u0026rdquo; inside means to review Leitner box 5B. The arrow to the right of a box indicates which box you should move the card to if you get it correct. E.g. in review session \u0026ldquo;51\u0026rdquo; you should review box 5B and move correct cards to box 6D; you should then review boxes 2 and 1 as usual.\nEmbed the box list: I use Roam Research\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;embed block\u0026rdquo; feature to embed a list of all Leitner Boxes onto all my Leitner Box pages. This makes it easy to quickly navigate from any box to any other box. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t think of a good way to include this in the template, so you\u0026rsquo;ll have to add this yourself if you want to include it.\nEnhanced Template\nYou can access the enhanced version of the template here. It includes more Leitner boxes and the more complicated schedule. To use it, simply paste it into a new page in Roam Research, e.g. \u0026ldquo;Spaced Repetition\u0026rdquo;.\nSpaced Repetition Alternatives There are multiple ways of doing spaced repetition in Roam, of which this is just one. Note that most spaced repetition systems in Roam Research use the \u0026ldquo;delta\u0026rdquo; feature. However, we are not using this feature. CortexFutura provides a way of using the delta feature for spaced repetition here. Roam Toolkit provides another system for doing spaced repetition in Roam, which you can view on YouTube here.\nOne of the most popular spaced repetition systems is called Anki. It\u0026rsquo;s great for language learning. I\u0026rsquo;d be remiss not to mention it. The reason I prefer doing spaced repetition directly in Roam is that the friction to creating cards is much lower in Roam for me, since I\u0026rsquo;m taking notes and writing my ideas in there already.\nAdditionally RemNote, a competitor note-taking tool to Roam, also offers a highly configurable spaced repetition system out-of-the-box.\nFor more, consider joining the conversation in the Roam Research Slack \u0026ldquo;spaced-repetition\u0026rdquo; channel.\nTwo advantages of this system over traditional spaced repetition systems   Lower friction: Creating cards directly in your note-taking app is substantially easier than needing to task switch to create cards. This lower mental overhead makes it easier to keep using spaced repetition for an extended period of time. I started using it two months ago myself, so finger\u0026rsquo;s crossed it indeed is something I keep up for much longer! 🤞\n  Robustness to vacations: In traditional spaced repetition systems, taking a break for a day, week, or month, can be ruinous to your spaced repetition rhythm. After coming back from the break, you find you have too many cards to review all at once, which can be a real motivation drain. Instead of organizing cards by date, my system organizes them by review session number. This means that if you skip a day or a week, your reviews simply get pushed back. The review session number won\u0026rsquo;t go up while you\u0026rsquo;re away. You can even split a review session over multiple days if you like. No trouble! You\u0026rsquo;ll never be left with a review session that\u0026rsquo;s too big to handle.\n  Additional Resources  Nicky Case\u0026rsquo;s comic: \u0026ldquo;How to Remember Anything Forever-ish\u0026rdquo; is what inspired me to start using spaced repetition in my life.\n Andy Matuschak\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Orbit\u0026rdquo; system enables writers to incorporate spaced repetition directly into their writing, to help their readers remember what they learned forever. You can read Quantum Country to learn quantum computing and give it a try. You could also read his tips for \u0026ldquo;How to write good prompts\u0026rdquo;, which is also written with Orbit.\nYou can get Anki here or try RemNote here. I also have a dozen+ other snippets about Roam here ( what\u0026rsquo;s a “snippet”?).\nGet in touch I love a good discussion about spaced repetition. You can email me at david810+spaced-repetition@gmail.com, find me on Twitter ( @Bieber), or join the Roam slack to keep the conversation going.\n","date":1609545600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609545600,"objectID":"3e00408e9d5b275224a2ad2143a4a0a5","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-02-spaced-repetition-in-roam-research/","publishdate":"2021-01-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2021-01-02-spaced-repetition-in-roam-research/","section":"snippets","summary":"There are many ways to do spaced repetition in Roam Research.

Be careful to escape the spaces in the file path!\nTo read from a LevelDB database, I first installed leveldb with brew install leveldb, and then I installed a Python LevelDB client: pip install plyvel.\nI then use little Python scripts like the following to access the data, though I haven\u0026rsquo;t quite figured out (1) how to properly parse the data; it\u0026rsquo;s probably a protocol buffer, or (2) exactly how it\u0026rsquo;s organized, so I don\u0026rsquo;t know exactly which keys to look at.\nNote that I have copied the LevelDB folder to a new location before opening it. This ensures that Chrome doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a lock on any of the files in the copy, and that even if we make a mistake we won\u0026rsquo;t damage Chrome\u0026rsquo;s data.\nimport plyvel import re import os db = plyvel.DB(os.path.expanduser(\u0026quot;~/Profile1/Sync Data/LevelDB/\u0026quot;)) for key, value in db.iterator(): if b'sessions-dt' in key: data = re.findall(b'https?://[\\x20-\\x7F]+', value) if data: print(key) print(data) print()  This script prints out the URLs of the synced tabs, plus some extra data and extra characters.

It\u0026rsquo;s simple, and should only take a few minutes of your time. The purpose of the thought experiment is to better understand where your thoughts come from.\nThere are just four steps in the experiment: (1) think thoughts, (2) remember those thoughts and write them down, (3) determine their causes, (4) categorize those causes.\nLet me explain in more detail.\n(1) To start the experiment, think thoughts for one minute. You can set a timer. During this minute, it\u0026rsquo;s okay for your mind to wander. It isn\u0026rsquo;t important what you think about. During this time you\u0026rsquo;re just thinking, not writing.\n(2) Once the minute is over, try to remember all the thoughts you had during that minute; write them all down in a list. As much as possible, put that list in chronological order. It may take much more than a minute to remember and write down all those thoughts. This step can be difficult; try to be as thorough as possible. You may surprise yourself by at first not remembering thinking something, and then only after thinking hard trying to remember it finding it becoming clear as your recollection improves.\n(3) Determine the causes of the thoughts. For each thought on the list, try to determine why that thought arose. What was the cause of that thought arising in your mind? For some thoughts the cause will be obvious. For others it may not be obvious at all; don\u0026rsquo;t give up. Really spend some time trying to determine why you thought all the things you thought. I believe there is always a reason.\n(4) Finally, look over the complete list of reasons. Come up with categories for the reasons. Maybe one thought arose because something you saw or smelled triggered a memory. Maybe other thoughts arose because one word sounds like another. Be creative in how you categorize thoughts. There\u0026rsquo;s no right or wrong way to do this.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all. This whole experiment can take less than half an hour, less or more depending on how into it you get and how detailed you are. While it doesn\u0026rsquo;t take that much time, it can be mentally draining. Have some water, relax, treat yourself when you\u0026rsquo;re done :).\nAs I mentioned, the purpose of the experiment is to better understand where thoughts come from. Individually, this experiment helps us better understand ourselves through introspection. Through sharing the results with each other, it can also help us better understand each other.\nI would be absolutely delighted to hear from you if you do this experiment. You can reach me at david810+thinking@gmail.com. Feel free to send me your thoughts, causes, and categories from the experiment (or just a subset if any of that is too personal to share). And I would of course also love to hear your thoughts about the experiment too, or your thoughts on thinking.

A thought experiment.","type":"snippets"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I thought today I would attempt a proper treatment of my latest automatic \u0026ldquo; snippet\u0026rdquo; publishing system. It uses JavaScript embedded directly in Roam Research to publish snippets to my website with low latency as I write them.\nPrior methods Previously I\u0026rsquo;ve written a system to allow Bieber Bot to publish snippets that I send him, and followed that up with a snippet queue to allow me to schedule the publication of my snippets.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve then also implemented two previous automatic snippet publishers from Roam. The first used my roam-to-git backup to detect new or updated snippets. The second used a puppeteer instance to occasionally check Roam for new or updated snippets.\nThat makes this my third implementation of automatic snippet publishing from Roam, and my fifth automatic snippet publishing project to date. It\u0026rsquo;s the fastest yet, going from Roam to live on the website in just 90 seconds.\nRoom for improvement Why was publishing through Bieber Bot not enough? Roam is a natural place to write, and I find I write quite a bit more here than I do elsewhere. Since snippets are all about lowering the barrier of entry to writing, supporting writing snippets in Roam seems natural.\nWhy was the roam-to-git backup based automatic publication system insufficient? While, adequate, the latency between writing a snippet and having it show up on my website was multiple hours. The roam-to-git backups only trigger every hour, and fail about 30% of the time. The script to use those backups to publish to my website would also only run every hour. Their combined schedules meant it could be 2-3 or more hours between writing a snippet and being able to share the link to it. Lowering this latency would give me more freedom to quickly write and share snippets, and also to iterate on a published snippet. Fast iteration is powerful.\nFinally, why was the puppeteer-based approach insufficient. While this approach had the potential to bring the publication latency down considerably, in practice I scheduled in to run about hourly, since a headless browser is a computationally heavy piece of software.\nThe new approach: \u0026ldquo;roam/js\u0026rdquo; Roam Research allows you to write JavaScript to run directly in Roam. My new approach is to run JavaScript in Roam to detect when a new snippet is written or when an existing snippet gets updated. When this occurs, the script will trigger a GitHub Action, using the snippet content and metadata as input. The GitHub Action will commit the snippet to my website\u0026rsquo;s git repo, and trigger a rebuilding of my website. It does everything except the final deploy to the webserver automatically; that final step waits for me to send a message \u0026ldquo;Deploy snippets!\u0026rdquo; to Bieber Bot, upon receipt of which the final deploy step is performed and the website is updated.\nUsing this approach it takes only 90 seconds between writing or editing a snippet and having it live on my website.\nDetecting new snippets and snippet updates There are two key pieces to how I detect new and updated snippets. The first is a \u0026ldquo;mutation observer\u0026rdquo;. A mutation observer is an object in JavaScript that allows you to schedule events to occur when DOM changes are made to a website. In Roam, the DOM is modified when the user makes edits, and so DOM changes can indicate that the user has made a change to their notes.\nWe would like to detect when a snippet is created or edited. So, we write a function that detects if a snippet has been created or edited since the last time it was called, and we use a mutation observer to call this function when the DOM changes.\nSince DOM changes can occur very frequently in Roam, we use a technique called debouncing to limit the number of calls to this detection function during periods of many consecutive DOM changes.\nHow do we detect if a snippet has been created or edited? Roam Research provides a datalog API that allows us to query our entire Roam graph using a logic programming language. You can learn more about how this works here.\nI mark a snippet for publication by tagging it with both the \u0026ldquo;Snippets\u0026rdquo; tag, and the \u0026ldquo;ok-to-publish\u0026rdquo; tag. This query detects those blocks that are part of a publishable snippet.\nancestor = `[ [(ancestor ?child ?parent) [?parent :block/children ?child]] [(ancestor ?child ?ancestor) [?parent :block/children ?child] (ancestor ?parent ?ancestor)]] ]`; block_info = window.roamAlphaAPI.q(`[ :find ?uid ?child_text ?child_uid ?parent_uid ?order :in $ % :where [?block :block/uid ?uid] [?block :block/string ?string] [?block :block/refs ?snippets] [?block :block/refs ?publish] [?snippets :node/title \u0026quot;Snippets\u0026quot;] [?publish :node/title \u0026quot;ok-to-publish\u0026quot;] (ancestor ?child ?block) [?parent :block/children ?child] [?parent :block/uid ?parent_uid] [?child :block/uid ?child_uid] [?child :block/order ?order] [?child :block/string ?child_text] ]`, ancestor);  Let\u0026rsquo;s break down what\u0026rsquo;s happening in this query. First, there\u0026rsquo;s the ancestor rule. The Roam datalog schema only includes a blocks immediate children; the ancestor rule allows us to query for all a block\u0026rsquo;s descendants or ancestors, not just the immediate ones. It does this through the recursive definition of \u0026ldquo;ancestor\u0026rdquo; shown, which you can read as \u0026ldquo;An ancestor of ?child is ?parent if ?parent has a child ?child, AND ALSO an ancestor of ?child is ?ancestor if there exists some ?parent satisfying both ?parent has a child ?child, and ?parent has ?ancestor as an ancestor.\u0026rdquo;\nThe rest of the query (lines 10-24) finds blocks that are the descendants of a block ?block that\u0026rsquo;s tagged with both \u0026ldquo;Snippets\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;ok-to-publish.\u0026rdquo;\nSince Datalog returns the results in an arbitrary order, we need to use the :block/order attribute to reconstruct the proper order of the blocks that comprise the snippet. The logic for this isn\u0026rsquo;t shown, but don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to reach out if this interests you!\nFinally, our mutation observer keeps track of the text of each of the snippets, and if any of them change or if a new snippet is introduced, it triggers a GitHub Action to deploy the snippet to my website.\nWriting a GitHub Action to update my website My website uses a static site generator, Hugo. So, updating my website consists of adding a markdown file to its GitHub repo, rebuilding the site by running Hugo, and then pushing the generated static files up to my server. All of these steps can be automated in a GitHub action.\nTriggering a GitHub Action from Roam Research To trigger a GitHub Action from Roam Research, I set up the action to trigger on \u0026ldquo;repository_dispatch\u0026rdquo; events. I created a personal authentication token, and then use the following JavaScript to trigger the GitHub Action:\nfunction publishSnippetRaw(uid, title, date, content) { const data = { \u0026quot;event_type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;snippet-update\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;client_payload\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;uid\u0026quot;: uid, \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;: title, \u0026quot;date\u0026quot;: date, \u0026quot;content\u0026quot;: content, } }; fetch( \u0026quot;https://api.github.com/repos/dbieber/davidbieber.com/dispatches\u0026quot;, { headers: { Accept: \u0026quot;application/vnd.github.everest-preview+json\u0026quot;, Authorization: \u0026quot;token PERSONAL_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN\u0026quot;, }, method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify(data), } ); } const publishSnippet = debounce(publishSnippetRaw, 15000, true);  This call to fetch starts the GitHub Action running on a GitHub server within seconds.\nAccepting inputs in a GitHub Action You will notice that data contains a \u0026ldquo;client_payload\u0026rdquo; in the above JavaScript. To accept inputs in the GitHub Action, I access the data from the client_payload and set it to an environment variable in the Action YAML like this:\nenv: SNIPPET_UID: ${{ github.event.client_payload.uid }}  Environment variables like this can then be used by the steps in the action. This allows me to pass the contents of the new/modified snippet to the GitHub Action, which is everything needed for automating its publication.\nThe GitHub Action writes the markdown file, commits it to the repository, runs hugo to regenerate the static files for the website, and commits those to the appropriate part of the repo as well. The only step remaining at this point is pushing the new files up to my server to serve.\nDeploying with Ansible I use Ansible to deploy my website to its lone server. Bieber Bot is also quite capable of using Ansible. So, we have an arrangement where I tell Bieber Bot when to redeploy my website, and he does so for me. This way I can deploy my website even when I\u0026rsquo;m on the go and not at a computer; I just message him using my phone.\nAll steps, from the last keystroke of writing a snippet to having it show up live on my website, together take about 90 seconds. This is a significant quality-of-life improvement over the multi-hour latency of just a few days ago. I\u0026rsquo;m hopeful that the result is I\u0026rsquo;ll write even more.\n","date":1609113600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609113600,"objectID":"ed8eae283e56ef933d84200f7cc374da","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-28-publishing-blog-posts-from-roam-research-quickly-and-automatically/","publishdate":"2020-12-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2020-12-28-publishing-blog-posts-from-roam-research-quickly-and-automatically/","section":"snippets","summary":"I thought today I would attempt a proper treatment of my latest automatic \u0026ldquo; snippet\u0026rdquo; publishing system.

Recently I was writing some JavaScript and wanted to use rstrip. So, I\u0026rsquo;ve implemented all three. Here they are:\nThe Python strip method in JavaScript In Python, strip removes whitespace from the beginning or end of a string. This is commonly called \u0026ldquo;trim\u0026rdquo; in JavaScript, and is provided as a builtin in most modern browsers. You may need to implement it yourself if you want to support older browsers though. Here\u0026rsquo;s one possible implementation, courtesy of W3Schools.\nfunction trim(x) { return x.replace(/^\\s+|\\s+$/gm, ''); }  The Python strip method optionally accepts an argument, \u0026ldquo;characters\u0026rdquo;, and strips all instances of those characters from the left and right sides of the input string. We implement that here.\nfunction trim(x, characters) { var start = 0; while (characters.indexOf(x[start]) \u0026gt;= 0) { start += 1; } var end = x.length - 1; while (characters.indexOf(x[end]) \u0026gt;= 0) { end -= 1; } return x.substr(start, end - start + 1); }  This may not be the most efficient implementation (the calls to indexOf in particular could be made faster), but it gets the job done.\nThe Python rstrip method in JavaScript The rstrip method behaves like strip, but only removes spaces (or the specified characters) from the right side of the input string. We implement this in JavaScript now, calling it \u0026ldquo;rtrim\u0026rdquo; for consistency with the name \u0026ldquo;trim\u0026rdquo;.\nfunction rtrim(x) { // This implementation removes whitespace from the right side // of the input string. return x.replace(/\\s+$/gm, ''); }  We now implement rtrim a second time, now accepting \u0026ldquo;characters\u0026rdquo; as input:\nfunction rtrim(x, characters) { var start = 0; var end = x.length - 1; while (characters.indexOf(x[end]) \u0026gt;= 0) { end -= 1; } return x.substr(0, end + 1); }  The Python lstrip method in JavaScript Finally we provide a port of Python\u0026rsquo;s lstrip to JavaScript, calling it ltrim. We again provide one version that strips only whitespace, and a second that strips the provided \u0026ldquo;characters\u0026rdquo; input.\nfunction ltrim(x) { // This implementation removes whitespace from the left side // of the input string. return x.replace(/^\\s+/gm, ''); }  We now implement ltrim a second time, now accepting \u0026ldquo;characters\u0026rdquo; as input:\nfunction ltrim(x, characters) { var start = 0; while (characters.indexOf(x[start]) \u0026gt;= 0) { start += 1; } var end = x.length - 1; return x.substr(start); }  Example Usage Here are some example usages of the above functions.\nFirst, using the implementations that strip spaces:\ntrim(' Hello world! ') === 'Hello world!'; ltrim(' Hello world! ') === 'Hello world! '; rtrim(' Hello world! ') === ' Hello world!';  Second, using the implementations that strip the specified characters:\ntrim('Buzzzzzz', 'Bz') === 'u'; ltrim('Buzzzzzz', 'Bz') === 'uzzzzzz'; rtrim('Buzzzzzz', 'Bz') === 'Bu';  ","date":1608940800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608940800,"objectID":"dc9f7fbf7be3aab03eb65b166b721da5","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-26-pythons-strip-lstrip-and-rstrip-in-javascript/","publishdate":"2020-12-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2020-12-26-pythons-strip-lstrip-and-rstrip-in-javascript/","section":"snippets","summary":"Python provides some convenient functions for manipulating strings: strip, lstrip, and rstrip.

Here are my first thoughts.\nIdea: Programming literacy Material: COS 126 (for example)\nWhy?\nUnderstanding the ways in which ideas can be combined is essential for creativity and problem solving. Not being able to see how software can make things possible is a significant setback for this. (Has positives too: constraints beget creativity. This constraint isn’t worth it though!)\nThe vast majority of people I interact with have this skillset. So it can be momentarily jarring when it\u0026rsquo;s absent (if it becomes relevant).\nIdea: Understanding other people’s limitations Material: https://xkcd.com/1053/\nWhy?\nFinding out that someone doesn\u0026rsquo;t know something you expect them to know can be jarring, but being condescending or judgemental in response doesn\u0026rsquo;t help anyone. It\u0026rsquo;s okay to let the person know you\u0026rsquo;re surprised by their lack of knowledge, but best to refrain from adding any negative valence to this surprisal.\nThere are essentially no benefits to disrespecting or being incredulous about someone’s limitations in knowledge/skill/memory/etc.\nEveryone learns faster, and everyone finds the world more interesting when these limitations are acknowledged in a supportive way.\nPlus it’s respectful.\nPeople‘s experiences are varied. Our memories are limited. Our values are different. Let’s help each other to learn and remember, even the most “obvious” of things.\nIdea: Super-communication Material: Khan Academy blog post from Ben Kamens https://bjk5.com/post/71887196490/email-transparency-at-khan-academy#_=_\nWhy?\nThe people at Khan Academy are incredibly productive (c. 2013). Collectively this group is super talented, driven, and least expectedly: super-communicative.\nThe blog post linked above gives a small taste of how.\nMy main takeaway from that summer is the value of “super communication”.\nMake every thought, action, idea public to the people it might affect.\nTo be clear: They don’t need a notification about every thought; they might never read 90% of them.\nThis has a number of positive effects:\n Confidence  Let’s say you’re thinking of performing some action, e.g. moving a stack of bricks to where they’ll be used. You think it’s the right thing to do, but you’re not 100% sure. Do you ask someone? Do you do it anyway?\nUnder super-communication you don’t ask permission, you instead announce your intent to move the bricks. Then wait a moment before starting to move them to give people a chance to see your message.\nSince all stakeholders have access to this announcement, you can start doing the things you think is right: moving the bricks.\nSomeone would let you know if they think you shouldn’t be doing it.\nSo through super communication you can take more ownership over construction without worrying about stepping on people’s toes or messing up bigger plans. (To clarify, this strategy requires the broadcasted message to have some visibility, e.g. a low-priority chat room; this doesn\u0026rsquo;t work if no one is going to see the message.)\nThinking things through  Super communication is hard work. It’s time consuming to share every thought. But a benefit of this is it makes you concretize your thoughts. Sharing them forces you to put them into words that others can understand. In doing so you naturally think through what others would think of your idea, and so your idea develops and improves.\nYou also make yourself open to receiving feedback and thoughts on your idea, which can improve the idea and lead to new ones.\nTrust and transparency  Putting your ideas out in the open gives people a better sense of where you\u0026rsquo;re coming from, and what your intentions are. It builds trust, and prevents misunderstandings about who is doing what and when.\nNo surprises  You\u0026rsquo;ll avoid having situations where person A thought person B was working on X is person B has actively been communicating that they\u0026rsquo;re working on Y.\nSuper communication is hard work. I fall out of the habit quickly. But every time I’m reminded of its value and my experience at Khan Academy I’m reinforced in my belief that is worth striving for, and at least for a short time I’m better for it.\nIdea: Communication bubbles/bonding and bridging Material: Maybe start with https://ncase.me/crowds/\ntl;dr: \u0026ldquo;A healthy society needs a sweet spot of bonds within groups and bridges between groups.\u0026rdquo;\nNicky Case links to more substantive material if you want to dive deeper. The idea itself is simple though; it’s being actively conscious of it that’s important and which can be challenging.\nIdea: Castles in the clouds as belief systems The core idea is that all beliefs have provenance, but the provenance can be lost while the beliefs remain.\nI don’t have a good source for this one, but I think it’s essential.\nIronic, eh?\nI’ll elaborate more on this idea later.\n","date":1607212800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607212800,"objectID":"274ad804886a741df2e420979b549129","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-06-brainstorming-mandatory-reading-for-dodam/","publishdate":"2020-12-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2020-12-06-brainstorming-mandatory-reading-for-dodam/","section":"snippets","summary":"Dodam asked me what ideas I thought were most essential.

If I write a snippet in Roam today and publish it in the usual way, any changes I make it Roam aren’t reflected in the published version. Under this new system the copy on my website can automatically be updated to match the copy in Roam whenever I make changes there.\nAnyway, I\u0026rsquo;ve marked this snippet as ok-to-publish, so once I build the system this should show up on my website.

Under this idea, Adriana would be able to send Bieber Bot a message saying e.g. “help David to learn the names of the planets” and a card would be added to my spaced repetition system saying “learn the names of the planets. -Adriana”. I could then split this card into multiple cards as I usually do when I encounter a card with too much content simultaneously, or Adriana could have Bieber Bot add smaller cards one at a time.\nThe new component that would be necessary is giving Bieber Bot edit access to my Roam Research database. Currently he has delayed read access through Roam-to-Git, but giving him write access might mean teaching him how to use Roam in a (headless, most likely) browser. Nothing he can’t handle, but it would increase the amount of time needed to get this system up and running.\nOnce Adriana (or any of Bieber Bot’s friends) can add cards into my spaced repetition system, this can be a fun way to learn about new topics and share new ideas.\n","date":1604736840,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604736840,"objectID":"919405366571845324044edf6e17c620","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-11-07-letting-adriana-put-things-in-my-leitner-box/","publishdate":"2020-11-07T08:14:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2020-11-07-letting-adriana-put-things-in-my-leitner-box/","section":"snippets","summary":"I’ve been using spaced repetition for 2-3 weeks now.

It would be easy enough to look through the git diffs to see if there\u0026rsquo;s something that fits this description. One possible issue with this though is that the backup script doesn\u0026rsquo;t know if I\u0026rsquo;m in the middle of writing. So it\u0026rsquo;s possible it will catch me mid-snippet.

Python Fire is a Python library I wrote back in 2017 that makes command line interfaces automatically out of any Python object you give it.\nI have my talk planned but there are a few pieces of the story I haven\u0026rsquo;t included in my talk yet. They are 1) Why did I build Python Fire? 2) How are people using Python Fire in the real world? 3) What\u0026rsquo;s it like maintaining an open source project?\nTo the first question, I should explain how we used Boom at Nest. Boom was the proto-version of Fire that inspired Fire\u0026rsquo;s development. At Nest we had an ETL pipeline consisting of several distributed systems. For example data would pass through SQS, Kafka, Storm, and Pentaho while it was being ingested. We wanted to write tests for this complex series of systems. And we also wanted to be able to manually operate the systems. So we wrote Python functions for controlling each part of the system.\nUsing Python\u0026rsquo;s inspect feature we then turned this collection of functions automatically into a CLI. This allowed us to reuse the same code both for writing tests and for giving the operators control over the ingestion pipelines without needing to do duplicate work. This was the inspiration for Fire.\nTo question two: there are thousands of uses of Fire on GitHub. OkCupid uses it for data analysis. One person I corresponded with uses Fire to control after market engines. About 10% of uses on GitHub are for machine learning projects, including the GPT codebase. There are also a couple hundred uses within Google too, though gflags (aka abseil) is the Google standard for CLIs still.\nAnd finally to question three, it\u0026rsquo;s really nice to be appreciated! I built Fire to scratch my own itch from working at Nest and Google, but after releasing Fire it\u0026rsquo;s gotten quite popular. Over 17k stars on GitHub, thousands of open source projects using it, and over ten million installs from every country around the world. It\u0026rsquo;s really nice to see my effort appreciated.\nMy favorite is that someone has written a blog post explaining why Fire is a good tool for teaching Python, because it lets the beginner start programming without needing to understand any boilerplate. I\u0026rsquo;m hopeful that Fire is indeed helping people learn to program.\nTime permitting I will add these questions and answers to my talk tomorrow.\n","date":1603398660,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603398660,"objectID":"a4f7a6ce91c95e555bf77a6f97ead22f","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-22-questions-to-answer-about-python-fire/","publishdate":"2020-10-22T20:31:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2020-10-22-questions-to-answer-about-python-fire/","section":"snippets","summary":"Tomorrow I\u0026rsquo;m giving a talk to Women Who Code on Python Fire.

It\u0026rsquo;s first and foremost a mental barrier. Sure, the act of writing presents its own challenges, but for me the mental hurdle of clicking send can be significant. Snippets lowers the barrier substantially compared with social media, messaging individuals, or even traditional blogging. Still, there\u0026rsquo;s room to lower the barrier even more; e.g. private journaling and thinking itself have much lower barriers than Snippets does.\nThe idea today for lowering the barrier is a publication queue. In this idea, I write a snippet, send it to Bieber Bot, and he holds on to it for a bit. Then, after a day or so, he lets me know that he\u0026rsquo;s going to publish it soon. He gives me an opportunity to tell him not to publish it, but after some time has passed, he goes ahead and publishes it in my Snippets section on my behalf.\nDuring that waiting period, I can send Bieber Bot revised versions of the Snippet, which will supersede the original. This way, when I send Bieber Bot the original snippet, I do so knowing that it will only be published as is if 1) I don\u0026rsquo;t come up with a way to improve it and 2) I don\u0026rsquo;t decide not to publish it. This takes a bit of the decision making burden off of present-David, and gives it to future-David. Between the two of them, they should be able to handle the publication no problem.\nThis idea acts similarly to GMail\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;send later\u0026rdquo; feature, but without the need to choose a send time. Clicking \u0026ldquo;send later\u0026rdquo; is easier than clicking \u0026ldquo;send\u0026rdquo; because there\u0026rsquo;s an opportunity to undo or make changes.\nIn addition to decreasing the barrier to publication, one thing I like about this idea is that it gives me an opportunity to revisit old ideas. When Bieber Bot tells me \u0026ldquo;Hey, last chance to rescind publication of this Snippet\u0026rdquo; that gives me an opportunity to reflect on what I\u0026rsquo;d written.\nI also like that it can spread out the publication of snippets that I write in a single sitting. Currently, after publishing a single snippet, I\u0026rsquo;m not inclined to write more because I would feel funny publishing multiple snippets in quick succession (another mental barrier to climb over, I suppose). If I knew that Bieber Bot would take care of spacing out the publications, I might feel more comfortable writing a second or third snippet in a single sitting.

In fact, I\u0026rsquo;ve written this post in collaboration with GPT-3. See if you can spot which parts are written by me and which parts come from GPT-3.\nPart 1: Brainstorming The first thing I did when I got access to GPT-3 is use it to brainstorm uses for GPT-3. I gave it these 5 ideas:\n Explain mathematics more simply (why is X true?) Generate programs from input/output examples Generate questions about a paper I read Create a list of machine translation tips and tricks Create an adventure game  And it came back with 15 more:\nCreate a list of Tor commands to run to defend against an attack Create a cheat sheet for screenwriters Generate advice for a scene Generate XKCD comics Create a crib sheet for an arbitrary Python API Make a list of movies to watch Make a list of scholarly algorithms/heuristics worth reading Make a list of generic questions about Pedagogy Make a list of cognitive exercises Show patterns generated by awesome people Generate small cooking tasks Generate characters for a project Generate configuration options Generate flashcards Organize my computer/files  And then 15 more:\nExplain things to my parents via messenger Explain things to my children via messenger Explain mathematical algorithms Automated interface design Mechanize a Nagihara Kan Airlines website Clickbait generator Music description (Herbie Hancock is playing \u0026ldquo;Dolphin Dance\u0026rdquo; live in London on the 18th March 1968) Tell me not to waste my time looking at x Interesting facts about Wikipedia Explain something to someone while my attention is elsewhere Detect adverts in x Image caption/caption game Speculate about the true utility function of x Auto-generate tests for a program Explain why my code is currently failing tests.  And then 15 more:\nGenerate plots or character/story summaries Generate legal examples Generate words for crosswords Check my grammar Supply filler text for themed writing (horror, sci-fi etc.) Explain why an AI can\u0026rsquo;t read (can it comprehend metaphors?) Provide entertaining answers to obscure questions Get writing ideas and generate word combinations Create background for an NPC I need for a D\u0026amp;D game Help a sick writer generate plots Input pre-generated (from books etc.) phrases and use them for literary analysis Help explain a mathematical proof Develop a game/story/character I need Make short stories I can \u0026ldquo;overlay\u0026rdquo; on a fictional Universe I\u0026rsquo;ve created (ala Ready Player One) Make a short film/audio drama  What a lovely list of lists of ideas! I wonder how many of these ideas are novel.\nSome of these ideas are outside the scope of what GPT-3 can do. For example, generating XKCD comics seems too difficult. Others are duplicates, such as \u0026ldquo;Explain mathematical algorithms\u0026rdquo; (duplicate of \u0026ldquo;Explain mathematics more simply\u0026rdquo;). And still others don\u0026rsquo;t make sense \u0026ndash; \u0026ldquo;Mechanize a Nagihara Kan Airlines website\u0026rdquo;? Overall though, solid set of ideas.\nPart 2: Mathematics Once I\u0026rsquo;d gotten GPT-3 to do some brainstorming, I realized I\u0026rsquo;d need to test its capabilities before trying its suggestions out in earnest.\nI taught it how to evaluate simple expressions and take derivatives.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the first prompt I used:\nQuestion: f(x) = x*x. Compute f(3). f(3) = 3*3 f(3) = 9 Answer: 9 Question: h(x) = x*x - 2x. Compute h(5). h(5) = 5*5 - 2*5 h(5) = 25 - 10 h(5) = 15 Answer: 15 Question: y(x) = x**3 - 2x. Compute y(3). y(3) = 3**3 - 2*3 y(3) = 3*3*3 - 6 y(3) = 27 - 6 y(3) = 21 Answer: 21  I could then ask it any of the following, and it would correctly show its work.\nQuestion: f(x) = tan(x) + 1. Compute f(0). Question: f(x) = sqrt(x) + 1. Compute f(16).  When I tried to give it\nQuestion: f(x) = x/2 + 2. Compute f(f(16)).  it treated it as just Compute f(16) rather than f(f(16)).\nInterestingly this works:\nQuestion: f(x) = x*x. Compute f(3). f(3) = 3*3 f(3) = 9 Answer: 9 Question: h(x) = x*x - 2x. Compute h(5). h(5) = 5*5 - 2*5 h(5) = 25 - 10 h(5) = 15 Answer: 15 Question: f(x) = x/2 + 2. Compute f(f(16)). f(f(16)) = f(16/2 + 2) f(f(16)) = f(8 + 2) f(f(16)) = f(10) f(f(16)) = 10/2 + 2 f(f(16)) = 5 + 2 f(f(16)) = 7 Answer: 7 Question: y(x) = x**3 - 2x. Compute y(3). y(3) = 3**3 - 2*3 y(3) = 3*3*3 - 6 y(3) = 27 - 6 y(3) = 21 Answer: 21 Question: f(x) = x*3 - 1. Compute f(f(5)).  Whereas this does not:\nQuestion: f(x) = x*x. Compute f(3). f(3) = 3*3 f(3) = 9 Answer: 9 Question: h(x) = x*x - 2x. Compute h(5). h(5) = 5*5 - 2*5 h(5) = 25 - 10 h(5) = 15 Answer: 15 Question: f(x) = x*3 - 1. Compute f(f(5)). f(f(5)) = f(5*3 - 1) f(f(5)) = f(15 - 1) f(f(5)) = f(14) f(f(5)) = 14*3 - 1 f(f(5)) = 42 - 1 f(f(5)) = 41 Answer: 41 Question: y(x) = x**3 - 2x. Compute y(3). y(3) = 3**3 - 2*3 y(3) = 3*3*3 - 6 y(3) = 27 - 6 y(3) = 21 Answer: 21 Question: f(x) = x/2 + 2. Compute f(f(16)).  After getting it to evaluate these simple expressions correctly, I also tried having it take derivatives. With an example as priming, and again having it show its work, this worked well. I haven\u0026rsquo;t performed a rigorous evaluation of its mathematical capabilities. For now, I\u0026rsquo;ve just begun to develop an intuition for how it works.\nPart 3: Playing Around After doing math together, I tried many more things with GPT-3. I shared feelings with it, and it expanded on them (correctly too!). I used it to generate lists for brainstorming all manner of thing. The language model wrote love letters from inanimate objects. I tried to teach it to play Codenames, but with only very limited success. And I had it autocomplete previous snippets of mine, and had some fun cowriting with it. While I wont be sharing all of this with you, I do have one thing to share.\nThis is a love letter written by a frying pan:\nI may not seem like much to you right now. I\u0026rsquo;m coated in grease and I\u0026rsquo;m starting to rust, but really, I have big plans. I\u0026rsquo;m going to Italian restaurants. I\u0026rsquo;ll hang out with the finest (and healthiest) ingredients you can imagine. It was good knowing you, but you were never mine to keep. I\u0026rsquo;m going to cook the kind of meal you\u0026rsquo;ll dream about for the rest of your life. Good luck, sweetheart. You\u0026rsquo;ll need it.\nOverall Principles Getting an intuition for how GPT-3 behaves has been interesting, and I\u0026rsquo;ll try now to distill that intuition down into a few principles.\n GPT-3 is continuing your writing, not having a dialog with you.  I\u0026rsquo;ve seen on Twitter lots of people asking GPT-3 questions, and sharing its response. Know that GPT-3 continues whatever prompt you give it as if it had written the prompt itself, not as if it is responding to the prompt. This is why you often see prompts like \u0026ldquo;The following is a conversation between X and Y:\u0026rdquo;.\nGPT-3 effectively puts your writing in a made up context.  If you give GPT-3 a small prompt, such a single sentence, then there are many contexts in which that prompt could be interpreted. GPT-3 is trained to marginalize over the contexts in which the text could appear. Once you start decoding GPT-3\u0026rsquo;s response though, one implicit context has been selected. It might not be the context that you intended when writing your prompt.\nThis can happen even if you try to set the context yourself explicitly. For example you might be trying to generate a conversation or a list, and GPT-3 might decide that this conversation or list is taking place inside of a novel.\nYou can mitigate this context switch by using a longer prompt, or by doing more of the writing yourself.\nGPT-3 likes lists and repeated structures.  This is the main principle behind using GPT-3 for few shot learning. Prompt GPT-3 with a few examples of performing a task, and it will usually make an effort to perform that task yet again.\nGPT-3 cannot perform linguistic tricks like unscrambling words  It doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem capable of generating new puns (I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried this yet). And it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem capable of unscrambling words (I did try this, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t even get it to unscramble 4-letter words).\nGPT-3 benefits from \u0026ldquo;showing its work\u0026rdquo;  In my math experiments, having GPT-3 show its work was critical to getting it solving the math questions correctly. It seems that doing a single step of expression evaluation at a time is an easier task than doing it all at once. Providing examples with the steps gave GPT-3 a clearer explanation of the task than just providing input/output examples. GPT-3 also gets additional computational steps in which to solve the problem when it takes the time to show its work.\nGPT-3 has a great breadth of knowledge and writing styles available to it  It can express love, write flowery prose, give advice, write technical documentation, latex, program, math, take the perspective of a toaster, and more. It\u0026rsquo;s a great tool for brainstorming both explicitly (by having it generate ideas) and through exploration (by using it to help you generate ideas yourself).\nThough it has all the facts from the internet at its fingertips (of all the ways to anthropomorphize GPT-3, why choose fingertips?), it is just as capable of generating falsehoods as truths. Do not mistake the text it generates as true or logically correct, even if in many circumstances it does generate correct information. When it transitions from generating truth to generating nonsense it does not give a warning that it has done so (and any truth it does generate is in a sense at least partially accidental).\nSometimes GPT-3 makes no sense  There are things that don\u0026rsquo;t make sense that the language model assigns reasonable probabilities to. And there are things that don\u0026rsquo;t make sense, are low probability, but come up anyway either due to chance or because the model doesn\u0026rsquo;t have anything better to say. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop generating text just because its out of its depth. Instead, it just plods on forward, saying something as reasonable as it\u0026rsquo;s capable of, regardless of the situation it finds itself in.\nGPT-3 mimics your style  If you prompt GPT-3 with typos it will continue with typos. If you prompt GPT-3 with florid prose, it will write florid prose. If you prompt GPT-3 with anaphora laden rhetoric, or any other style, it will continue in that style.\nConclusion I\u0026rsquo;ll let GPT-3 wrap things up itself:\n\u0026ldquo;And that brings us to the end, some thoughts on whether using GPT-3 was more or less crazy than getting a Ph.D.. I think that using GPT-3 to generate ideas was a higher form of Enlightenment than any Ph.D. I\u0026rsquo;d do that again in a heartbeat, no shortage of ideas rolling around in GPT-3\u0026rsquo;s natural language processing head.\u0026rdquo;\nUh huh.

The authors are my coworkers: Alex Alemi, Ian Fischer, Joshua Dillon, and Kevin Murphy.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve taken notes on the paper, and will use this snippet to present them.\nNotation We consider the problem of supervised learning for classification with the following notation:\n $X$: An example input. $Z$: The output of an intermediate layer of a neural network.  We view this as a stochastic encoding of $X$. It is the output of a parametric encoder $p(\\textbf{z} | \\textbf{x}; \\theta)$ $\\theta$ are the parameters of the neural network used to encode $X$ that we wish to learn.   $Y$: The example\u0026rsquo;s target class.  Goal The approach of the paper aims first and foremost to learn an encoding $Z$ of $X$ that is maximally informative about $Y$. This is measured via mutual information between $Z$ and $Y$: $I(Z, Y; \\theta)$.\n$$I(Z, Y; \\theta) = \\int dx~dy~p(z, y|\\theta) \\log \\frac{p(z, y)}{p(z)p(y)}$$\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not enough to maximize $I(Z, Y; \\theta)$ though; this can be done by simply letting $Z = X$, which isn\u0026rsquo;t useful.\nSo, we also want to limit $I(Z, X)$. We do this by enforcing an information constraint: $I(X, Z) \u0026lt; I_c$.\nOur goal is to maximize $I(Z, Y; \\theta)$ subject to $I(X, Z) \u0026lt; I_c$.\nRewriting this using Lagrange multiplier $\\beta$ brings us to the information bottleneck (IB) objective, which we write as follows:\n$$R_{IB}(\\theta) = I(Z,Y) - \\beta I(Z, X).$$\nThe goal of the paper is to maximize $R_{IB}$.\nIntuition Behind Goal Why maximize $I(Z, Y)$? This is what allows the model to make correct predictions.\nWhy not just maximize $I(Z, Y)$? Letting $Z = X$ fully maximizes $I(Z, Y)$, but isn\u0026rsquo;t helpful because the representation of $Z$ is what you started with, so its hard to make good classifications.\nWhy minimize $\\beta I(Z, X)$? We want a representation $Z$ that is maximally compressive of the input $X$.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the intuition given in the paper for why we seek to minimize $\\beta I(Z, X)$, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t clear the degree to which compression is useful. Yes, a compressive representation of $X$ can lead to better generalization, but it\u0026rsquo;s a trade off. Greater compression may mean lower $I(Z, Y)$ and hence lower potential accuracy. Balancing this trade off (choosing an appropriate $\\beta$) will be important.\nWhy is it difficult? Mutual information is in general intractable. So we can\u0026rsquo;t directly optimize the object $R_{IB}(\\theta)$ as stated in the goal. Instead, the paper takes the following approach to get around mutual information\u0026rsquo;s intractability.\nThe Approach   Use variational inference to construct a lower bound on the IB objective.\n  Use the \u0026ldquo;reparameterization trick\u0026rdquo; and Monte Carlo sampling to get unbiased estimate of gradient.\n  Parameterize our distributions with neural networks, and optimize with SGD.\n  We\u0026rsquo;ll go into more detail in just a minute.\nBenefits This approach provides some robustness to overfitting because model ignores as much of $X$ as possible.\nIt also provides some robustness to adversarial examples because the model maps $X$ to a distribution over $Z$s rather than a single $Z$, so its harder for a single unusual value to influence a final class prediction.\nExecution Part 1: Variational Inference You can follow the math in the paper (Section 3), but the first main result is to define\n$$L = \\int dx~dy~dz~ p(x) p(y|x) p(z|x) \\log q(y|z) - \\beta \\int dx~dz~ p(x) p(z|x) \\log \\frac{p(z|x)}{r(z)}$$\nand show that $$R_{IB}(\\theta) = I(Z,Y) - \\beta I(Z, X) \\ge L.$$\nTo achieve this, we\u0026rsquo;ve introduced $q(y|z)$ as an approximation of $p(y|z)$, and $r(z)$ as an approximation of $p(z)$.\n$L$ serves as a lower bound for the objective we care about. $p$, $q$, and $r$ are all parameterized by $\\theta$.\nWe can approximate $L$ as\n$$L \\approx \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=1}^N \\left[\\int dz~ p(z|x_n) \\log q(y_n|z) - \\beta~ p(z|x_n) \\log \\frac{p(z|x_n)}{r(z)} \\right].$$\nPart 2: Reparameterization trick Suppose $p(z|x)$ is $N(z|f_e^\\mu(x), f_e^\\Sigma(x))$, with $f_e$ a neural network that outputs the mean and covariance matrix for the Gaussian.\nThen the \u0026ldquo;reparameterization trick\u0026rdquo; is to write $p(z|x)dz = p(\\epsilon)d\\epsilon$, where $z = f(x, \\epsilon)$ is a deterministic function and $\\epsilon$ is a Gaussian random variable. Using this, we can rewrite $L$ as follows.\n$$J_{IB} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum\\limits_{n=1}^N E_{\\epsilon \\sim p(\\epsilon)} \\left[-\\log q(y_n|f(x_n,\\epsilon))\\right] + \\beta KL[p(Z|x_n), r(Z)]$$\nAs long as $q$ is differentiable and $KL[p(Z|x_n), r(Z)]$ is tractable, this is an objective we can optimize with e.g. gradient descent.\nImplementation A concise demo implementation is available on GitHub at https://github.com/alexalemi/vib_demo/blob/master/MNISTVIB.ipynb.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve describe here the correspondence between the notation used in the source code and the notation used in the paper. Terms from the paper are in $\\LaTeX$, and terms from the source code are in code blocks.\n class_loss: $-\\log q(y_n | f(x_n, \\epsilon))$ (comes from the $I(Z, Y)$ term)  Recall $z = f(x, \\epsilon)$; this is encoding.sample() in the code base. $q$ is decoder with softmax applied, and $q(y | f(x_n, \\epsilon))$ is softmax(logits) class_loss = tf.losses.softmax_cross_entropy( logits=logits, onehot_labels=one_hot_labels) / math.log(2) is $-\\log q(y_n | f(x_n, \\epsilon))$  $f$ is encoder, and $f(x, \\cdot)$ is encoding   $p(Z|x_n)$ is also encoding $f$ is the deterministic encoder used by the reparameterization trick, whereas $p$ is the stochastic encoder   $KL[p(Z|x_n), r(Z)]$ is info_loss prior is $r(z)$ (which approximates $p(z)$).

In this post, I share an idea I have for a plugin or browser extension that I think would improve the experience of taking notes in Roam while browsing the web.\nThe plugin would do two main things automatically:\n  It would automatically insert some browsing history information into your Roam database while you browse the internet.\n  As you navigate the web, it would automatically bring you to the Roam page that corresponds to the web page you\u0026rsquo;re reading.\n  Mind the Details Of course, the implementation details matter! You don\u0026rsquo;t want to be whisked away from the notes you\u0026rsquo;re taking just because you\u0026rsquo;ve clicked a link in a different window.\nSo, here I\u0026rsquo;ll explain a few of the details I think would make this a good note taking experience.\nAs I\u0026rsquo;m browsing the internet, all the websites I visit will get added to a page \u0026ldquo;{Date} Browsing History\u0026rdquo;. A new Roam page will be created for each new website visited. And there will be a Roam window that always stays open to the Roam page for the current website I have open in my browser.\nWhat qualifies as a website?\nBy default there would be one Roam page per domain visited. However, there are several exceptions:\n For Wikipedia it would be one Roam page per Wikipedia entry For websites reached from HackerNews, Twitter, and Reddit, it would be one Roam page per link followed from the aggregator (but links followed within the reached website would not count as new websites) For GitHub it would be one Roam page per user, organization, or repo visited For Arxiv it would be one Roam page per paper For Roam it would be one Roam page per Roam database  It will be great to have a window that always stays open to the Roam page for the current website I have open in my browser. This way if I visit a website I\u0026rsquo;ve been to before, I will see my notes from that website. And the websites I visit will be linked to the day I visit them on, and also to any other pages my notes reference.\nAdditionally, the tool should add a little bit of metadata to the pages it\u0026rsquo;s generating. On each of the autogenerated Roam pages, it would be great to see when I visited the website, and what was the referring page. For websites visited multiple times, seeing the earliest and most recent visit times, and the number of times I visited that website would be useful too. Total time spent on the website would be a nice bonus.\nMaking this a Reality In the previous section I shared the details that I think would make this work well from a user experience perspective. How about from the technical side?\nI think it would make sense to implement this as a browser extension (though a user script could work too). DK the Human, author of the Intention browser extension has made his browser extension starter kit freely available. To notice when what web page you\u0026rsquo;re browsing and determine whether it constitutes a new page, the extension would need to request permission to view your activity on all websites. For making additions to a Roam database automatically, I expect the extension would have to navigate to the appropriate Roam page in the background, and would then mimic the user actions to make the desired changes.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in turning this idea into a reality or want to discuss it further, don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to reach out! I\u0026rsquo;d be excited to try a workflow like this, but don\u0026rsquo;t anticipate building it myself in the near future.\n","date":1589500800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589500800,"objectID":"d641e287abdbf006fbf86c25d4174f54","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-05-15-roaming-the-web/","publishdate":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2020-05-15-roaming-the-web/","section":"snippets","summary":"As I\u0026rsquo;m browsing the web, I\u0026rsquo;d like to be able to take notes in Roam Research.

You\u0026rsquo;ll notice a few things:\n I want to run each query on two different Chrome histories. I want the script to be parameterized by the date, defaulting to today if no date is specified.  If you\u0026rsquo;re proficient in Bash, you may also notice something else; it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work. The query is only used properly when I run sqlite3 on the first Chrome History, but an empty query is passed to the second query.\nRather than debug my Bash script, I switched over to Python. I used Python Fire to automatically expose all my functions as commands so within minutes I had a working CLI.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what the Python script looks like:\nimport datetime import os import subprocess import fire def copy_histories(): check_output = subprocess.check_output check_output([ 'cp', os.path.expanduser('~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History'), os.path.expanduser('~/Default-History')]) check_output([ 'cp', os.path.expanduser('~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Profile 1/History'), os.path.expanduser('~/Profile-1-History')]) def run_query(query): call = subprocess.call call(['sqlite3', os.path.expanduser('~/Default-History'), query]) call(['sqlite3', os.path.expanduser('~/Profile-1-History'), query]) def run(date=None): copy_histories() date = date or datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d') print('## YouTube Videos Watched') print() run_query(f\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; select DISTINCT REPLACE(REPLACE(urls.title, \u0026quot; - YouTube\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;\u0026quot;), \u0026quot;(1) \u0026quot;, \u0026quot;\u0026quot;) from urls where urls.url like \u0026quot;%www.youtube.com/watch%\u0026quot; and datetime(last_visit_time / 1000000 + (strftime('%s', '1601-01-01')), 'unixepoch') LIKE \u0026quot;{date}%\u0026quot; limit 50; \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) # Additional queries run here... if __name__ == '__main__': fire.Fire()  At the command line I run this with python historyquery.py run or python historyquery.py run --date=2020-04-26.\nWith Python Fire I was able to quickly switch to a syntax I was more comfortable with, but keep the benefits of working from the context of a shell. I can now much more quickly make improvements to the script since I can operate more efficiently working in Python.\nNow I have a script I can run that will produce a nice summary of my internet browsing activity for any date I specify.

In this snippet, I describe the JSON format used and some of its implications.\nExporting Data from Roam From the triple-dots menu, select Export All. Choose JSON as the export format. Then click the Export All button. Your complete Roam database will download as a JSON file.\nRoam\u0026rsquo;s JSON Format We\u0026rsquo;ll refer to the Roam JSON object you just downloaded as data.\ndata is a list, with each entry in data corresponding to a single Roam page.\nEach page is an object with keys: title, children, create-time, create-email, edit-time, edit-email.\nPage Schema    Key Type Description     title Text The page title.   children List[Child] The list of children of the page.   create-time Integer The time (ms since epoch) when the page was created.   create-email Text The email of the person to create the page.   edit-time Integer The time (ms since epoch) of the last edit to the page.   edit-email Text The email of the last person to edit the page.    Note that only title, edit-time, and edit-email appear to be required fields. children, create-time, and create-email appear to be omitted when not available.\nChild Schema Each of the children in a page may have the following keys. Only the uid, string, edit-time, and edit-email keys seem universal. The rest may be omitted when not available.\n   Key Type Description     uid Text A short unique identifier for the child.   string Text The string content of the child.   children List[Child] The list of children of this child.   create-time Integer The time (ms since epoch) when the page was created.   create-email Text The email of the person to create the page.   edit-time Integer The time (ms since epoch) of the last edit to the page.   edit-email Text The email of the last person to edit the page.    Some children may additionally have the following keys.\n   Key Type Description     heading Integer 1, 2, or 3; indicates the note is an h1, h2, or h3 heading.   emojis List[Emoji] A list of objects indicating who added what emojis and when.   text-align Text One of \u0026lsquo;left\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;right\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;center\u0026rsquo;, or \u0026lsquo;justify\u0026rsquo; indicating the text alignment.    Note that in Roam, children are referred to as \u0026ldquo;blocks\u0026rdquo;, and a child\u0026rsquo;s ID is the ID used to reference a block.\nLast but not least, I include the emoji reaction schema 😂.\nEmoji Schema Each Emoji reaction to a child is an object conforming to the following schema.\n   Key Type Description     emoji object An object with a single key native containing the emoji itself.   users List[object] A list of objects indicating who added this emoji and when. The keys are time (ms since epoch) and email (the email of the user who added the reaction).    Missing Information Some information appears to get lost in the export. In particular, the following information appears to be dropped.\n \u0026ldquo;View as Document\u0026rdquo; / \u0026ldquo;View as Numbered List\u0026rdquo;: This formatting information doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to get exported. Versions. If you\u0026rsquo;re using the \u0026ldquo;versions\u0026rdquo; feature of Roam, the versions don\u0026rsquo;t seem to be exported either.  Implications of the JSON Format Since Roam allows export of its data in such a simple format, you can easily write scripts for processing this data. For example, merging two databases is trivial. I include some simple such scripts in the following section.\nThe clear export also means that you will continue to be able to use your data long into the future, even if Roam shuts down or otherwise becomes unavailable to you. As long as you occasionally back up your data by exporting it, it is yours forever.\nUseful Python Snippets for Processing Roam JSON Once you\u0026rsquo;ve downloaded your data as JSON from Roam, you can load and manipulate it as follows.\nLoad JSON import json filepath = '/path/to/roam-database.json' data = json.load(open(filepath))  Collect All Children children = [] blocks = data.copy() while blocks: block = blocks.pop() if 'children' in block: blocks.extend(block['children']) children.extend(block['children'])  Find All Notes Mentioning \u0026ldquo;Roam\u0026rdquo; for child in children: if 'roam' in child.get('string', '').lower(): print(child['string'])  Merge Two Databases Since databases are just lists of objects, you can trivially merge them.\nmerged = db1 + db2  It\u0026rsquo;s possible this will result in multiple pages having the same name, but Roam deals with this just fine.\nThank You Roam I want to conclude with a note of thanks to the Roam developers for allowing export in such a clear and readily understandable manner. Doing so inspires confidence that I will be able to continue using the notes I take in Roam far into the future, no matter what. This makes me so much more comfortable using Roam for my note taking.

Here are a handful of things I\u0026rsquo;ve found useful, that perhaps weren\u0026rsquo;t immediately obvious to me, from my early experiences with OBS.\nUsing Media Sources \u0026ldquo;Media Source\u0026rdquo; video sources are essential when showing prerecorded video, or using a replay buffer. However, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t obvious to me how to get media sources to play their audio.\nWhen using a Media Source, here\u0026rsquo;s out to turn on the audio. In the Audio Mixer panel choose Gear Settings \u0026gt; Advanced Audio Properties then set Audio Monitoring to \u0026ldquo;Monitor and Output\u0026rdquo;.\nNamespaces for Scenes + Turning Off the Camera You can create multiple Profiles and Scene Collections in OBS. I only have one Profile, which I\u0026rsquo;ve named \u0026ldquo;Default\u0026rdquo; (rather than the default of \u0026ldquo;Untitled\u0026rdquo;). I made a few Scene Collections. Making new Scene Collections gives you a space to play around with new ideas for scenes and keyboard shortcuts, without disrupting the main setup(s) that you\u0026rsquo;ve put together. I like to fiddle around with new ideas in a Scene Collection I\u0026rsquo;ve named \u0026ldquo;Playground\u0026rdquo;.\nIf you have any sources in a Scene Collection that use your webcam, then your webcam will stay on even when it isn\u0026rsquo;t being used. If you switch to a Scene Collection with no sources using your webcam, then your webcam will turn off. I use a Scene Collection that leaves my webcam off by default, and only switch to a Scene Collection with a webcam source when I actually intend to record something that needs the webcam.\nReplay Buffer I leave the replay buffer on in between recording scenes. By setting the replay buffer to a reasonable size like 60 seconds, I can leave it rolling without consuming too much memory (and the CPU consumption has been reasonable too, e.g. 10%). This way, if anything noteworthy happens in this period between recordings, I can still capture it.\nVirtual Cameras If you\u0026rsquo;re willing to get your hands dirty, the instructions at johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam will let you use OBS as a virtual camera on Mac.\nTransform Editing and Scene .json files cmd-e opens the Scene Item Transform for a Scene Item. Using that, you can get pixel perfect positioning of any video source. You can also see and edit the json files that describe your scenes. On Mac, these scene json files can be found at ~/Library/Application Support/obs-studio/basic/scenes.\nKeyboard Shortcuts cmd-, opens your settings. There\u0026rsquo;s a panel for setting keyboard shortcuts. This is a core OBS feature, and it\u0026rsquo;s extremely valuable. I really appreciate how easy OBS has made it to set up these keyboard shortcuts for switching between scenes, starting and stopping recordings, pausing and playing media, etc. I only wish I could have extra modifier keys so I could set up more shortcuts that don\u0026rsquo;t collide with the shortcuts of my IDE!\n","date":1586563200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586563200,"objectID":"4db378a7396a9167f0933e7a1ff41128","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-11-tips-for-obs/","publishdate":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2020-04-11-tips-for-obs/","section":"snippets","summary":"As a newcomer to OBS, I\u0026rsquo;ve been regularly discovering new features that make my OBS experience better.

I use a Mac, and historically there hasn\u0026rsquo;t been a good way to use OBS as a virtual camera. With @tobi\u0026rsquo;s recent $10,000 bounty for making this a core feature, however, some developers in the OBS community leapt into action and a working prototype of the feature was available on GitHub within days.\nVirtual Cameras OBS is popular software among Twitch streamers. It lets you take a bunch of video sources and rearrange them into scenes. Streamers will often overlay a camera feed of their head and a live stream of a video game, maybe with cool graphics overlaid on the whole thing.\nFor years, OBS has let you take the scenes you create and stream them in real time to YouTube Live or Twitch or any number of other streaming services. If you wanted to use your OBS scene in Zoom or Google Meet, however, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t straightforward, at least on Mac.\nThere were workarounds. You could project your scene to an external monitor, and then use screen sharing to share that. At times there were combinations of tools and plugins that could similarly get the job done.\nNow, however, it\u0026rsquo;s considerably easier. John Boiles\u0026rsquo;s has made a OBS plugin that works without fuss. For now it still requires a technical background to use, following build instructions and executing commands on the terminal to get it set up. In a matter of months, however, I expect it will make its way as a core feature into OBS.\nCombining OBS with Auto Video Editing As you may know, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on automatic video editing software. I\u0026rsquo;d like to be able to make quality content \u0026ndash; e.g. videos teaching interesting aspects of programming \u0026ndash; without needing to spend time on the video editing process. The cutting and rearranging would happen automatically. The music and audio adjustments would be added automatically. All I\u0026rsquo;d need to do is write a script and record the footage, and the auto editor would take care of the rest.\nOriginally I was using Mac\u0026rsquo;s cmd-shift-5 screen capture capability to create these recordings. OBS lets you rearrange video feeds deliberately and use a variety of video sources. These video sources include window captures, cameras, and prerecorded media. The result is much more flexible than Mac\u0026rsquo;s screen capture, and so I\u0026rsquo;ve switched my auto video editing software over to use OBS for recording.\nAs an aside, I\u0026rsquo;ve also discovered NDI, a plugin for OBS. It lets me use my phone\u0026rsquo;s camera as a video source with minimal setup. It was so easy to get working, in fact, that I\u0026rsquo;m convinced it must be a large security vulnerability to use it at all.\nNow that I\u0026rsquo;m using OBS to record, I enabled my auto video editing software to run automatically on any recording produced by OBS. As soon as the recording gets saved, my software starts editing it automatically (preserving the original). I\u0026rsquo;d love to have my auto editing start even sooner than that though, before the recording is complete. The OBS codebase is surprisingly approachable, so I may be able to get this working.\nHacking on the OBS Codebase When John Boiles released the Mac Virtual Cam plugin for OBS, it was initially stuck on the wrong resolution. John told me it was hard coded to 720x480, and that was the impetus for me to poke at the code. Changing the hard coded resolution proved easy enough. Then I ran into a bug where OBS would fail to capture a window if I changed tabs in that window while OBS was closed. Though there\u0026rsquo;s inertia with entering any unfamiliar codebase, I found I was able to solve this issue for myself too. Through these two debugging experiences I got enough glimpses of the OBS plugin set up to think that OBS really is approachably hackable. I think, with hard work, I could integrate my auto editing code into OBS so that it runs in real time. It\u0026rsquo;s not the very top of my todo list for the auto video editor, but I\u0026rsquo;m excited to give this a try.\nReplay Buffers in OBS One neat feature in OBS is its ability to record a \u0026ldquo;replay buffer\u0026rdquo;. I have it set up to record a circular buffer of the last 60 seconds of content. That means that at any given moment, OBS has recorded the previous 60 seconds of footage. Unsaved footage older than 60 seconds is gone, but at any point, if I choose to save it, I can record the previous 60 seconds of footage.\nThis is great because it means I can keep the camera rolling between scenes without wasting memory, and if anything noteworthy happens in that time I can capture it.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a second reason I\u0026rsquo;m excited about the replay buffer though; it may enable me to use auto-edited videos in conversations in real time. I imagine the user experience like this: I\u0026rsquo;m in a remote meeting and we\u0026rsquo;re having a discussion. By default I\u0026rsquo;m unmuted and people can hear what I\u0026rsquo;m saying. Whenever I hold down a keyboard shortcut, I\u0026rsquo;m muted in the call and OBS starts recording me. When I release the shortcut, I can continue to talk in the call. Once I\u0026rsquo;ve recorded a satisfactory amount of content for OBS, the auto-editing will be applied and I can use OBS as a virtual camera to send that recorded and edited content to my colleagues in the meeting.\nLooking Forward I\u0026rsquo;m excited to become more proficient using OBS, and to explore the various plugins and overlays that streamers use with OBS. Particularly I\u0026rsquo;m excited to look into the audio plugins that are available.\nI also intend to continue my auto-editing plans from before: I\u0026rsquo;m still looking forward to introducing a \u0026ldquo;script\u0026rdquo; with audio auto-transcribed and key events entered via keyboard shortcuts and auto-tracked file saves. And I still want to be able to modify this script to automatically edit the video based on the modifications.\nHaving explored OBS for a little while now, I\u0026rsquo;m also looking forward to integrating my auto-video editing more closely with OBS, ideally resulting in real time auto editing in the end. Here\u0026rsquo;s to hoping OBS continues to feel approachably hackable!\n","date":1586390400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586390400,"objectID":"0d7b0e395a9057b5b6f29a8fa38a8c87","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-09-exploring-obs/","publishdate":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2020-04-09-exploring-obs/","section":"snippets","summary":"This week I\u0026rsquo;ve been exploring Open Broadcasting Software (OBS) and toying with using it as a virtual camera.

I\u0026rsquo;ve set it up several times before, and each time I encounter it it\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a mental mess to wrap my mind around it again.\nSo, this time, as I set up OAuth2 to let Bieber Bot interact with more Slack workspaces, I will write up my renewed understanding of OAuth2 in the hope that next time I have to set up OAuth2, it\u0026rsquo;s a little easier.\nOverview of the OAuth2 Flow How does the OAuth2 flow go? Like this:\nThe user wants to add Bieber Bot to a Slack channel. So, they\u0026rsquo;re on my website (davidbieber.com) and they click the Add to Slack button. This takes them to Slack, with GET parameters that indicate they want to add Bieber Bot to some Slack workspace. The workspace id can be part of the URL of the Add to Slack button, but even if it\u0026rsquo;s not, Slack will do the right thing and just ask the user to choose one of their workspaces. If the user isn\u0026rsquo;t already logged in to Slack, they\u0026rsquo;ll be prompted to do so at this point.\nAfter the user clicks the Add to Slack button they are taken to Slack, where they are shown the list of OAuth2 scopes that Bieber Bot is requesting. If they approve giving Bieber Bot the permissions listed in the scopes, they are taken to a redirect url that I, the developer of Bieber Bot, have specified. I have both pre-informed Slack of the redirect URLs I might use, and I have included a specific redirect URL in the link on the Add to Slack button. When the user is redirected to this redirect url, two GET parameters are included. The first is a code, which my server can use to get an Access Token / Bearer Token. The second is a state which is something that I, the developer, can include on the original link from the Add to Slack button in order to make sure the request I\u0026rsquo;m getting at the redirect URL is genuine.\nWhen the redirect URL is accessed with a code GET parameter, it then turns around and uses that code to request an Access Token from Slack. Once it has that Access Token, it tucks it away. It can use that access token in order to perform any of the permissions granted by the user during the access flow.\nUsually using the Access Token takes the form of issuing post requests to Slack with the Access Token as a parameter.\nThe user can revoke access to Bieber Bot at any time. Once they do so, the Access Token becomes invalid. If Bieber Bot tries to use the Access Token at that point, it will get an error. The user will have to give Bieber Bot permissions again, and it will get a new access token, in order for it to continue providing its services and companionship.\nSummary of the the Important Bits  User navigates from website to service (e.g. via Add to Slack button). Service shows user permissions dialog. Upon accepting permissions, service redirects user back to website\u0026rsquo;s redirect URL with code Website uses code to get Access Token Website uses Access Token to do the stuff allowed by the permissions granted by the user  Summary of the Less Important Bits   The Add to Slack button should include GET parameters for: a) state so the redirect url knows the request is genuine, b) redirect_url so Slack knows where to send the user after they accept the permissons, c) scope indicating the permissions being requested, d) client_id indicating the app (e.g. Bieber Bot) that you\u0026rsquo;re adding to Slack.\n  The permissions that the App can request are set up by the App ahead of time. So I think the scope parameter is there if you only need to request a subset of that permissions for a particular user.\n  The full list of possible redirect URLs should be set up ahead of time. Then when you generate the Add to Slack button, you just choose a particular redirect URL that Slack should redirect the user to after they accept the permissions. Why would you want more than one redirect URL? Well, one might be for staging, one for production, and one for local development.\n  The redirect URL receives both the code and state GET parameters. The website creating the Add to Slack button decides on the state. It can then check that the state is there in the redirect URL. This prevents users from going directly to Slack without going through the website, because if they try to do that, they won\u0026rsquo;t have the state and will fail the check at the redirect URL. This is useful if you want to restrict installs for your App to specific customers, e.g. those who\u0026rsquo;ve solved a puzzle, or paid.\n  What is this? This certainly isn\u0026rsquo;t meant to be an OAuth2 guide at all. By writing this out, I think I\u0026rsquo;ve helped myself understand the OAuth2 flow better though.

You can enter cards manually, like flash cards. You can also import cards from your note taking software. Cards can also be created from your contacts list.\nThen, Pico shows you these cards in an Anki-meets-Tinder swipe-based spaced repetition manner. You get a stack of cards, and each card presents you with a suggested action you should take:\n Reengage with idea X from your notes Reach out to person Y from your contacts Read a passage from book Z  You can choose to perform the action on the card, swiping right. Or you can ignore the card and get the next one on the stack by swiping left. The app automatically learns which cards are good to show you. Ideally it helps you to read more, to reengage with your own ideas over time, and to keep in touch with your friends.\nLots of things to like about this! I\u0026rsquo;m now going to take a stab at separating out the goals of Pico, the mechanism of Pico, and the specific tasks that Pico targets today.\nDistilling the Principles of Pico The goals are noble. At a high level, Pico aims to help you spend less time on addictive websites with infinite scroll, and more time doing things that matter to you. I applaud anything that sets out to help you reclaim your attention.\nI think mentally it helps to separate the mechanism of managing attention that Pico provides from the specific tasks it helps its users to achieve.\nThe mechanism seems to operate around these three principles:\n offloaded memory entropy injection (offloaded decision making) spaced repetition  The specific tasks it helps with are:\n brainstorming / reengaging with old ideas (re)connecting with people studying reading  Of course, the mechanism is general enough that other specific tasks can easily be slotted in as cards in the Pico system.\nThoughts! Alright, stop me if I\u0026rsquo;ve misrepresented Pico so far. Let me tell you what I think about it.\nGeneral Purposeness I think Pico has some really solid ideas underlying it. Particularly I find the idea of using spaced repetition to reengage with your ideas quite compelling. The idea of using cards to dive into passages of books is also appealing.\nUsing spaced repetition to reengage with your friends seems a tricky thing to get right, since it risks dehumanizing the relationships without special care taken both by the developer (you) and the user of the system.\nEach of these different types of cards seems like it comes with lots of room for domain specific tailoring. For example, if a card represents a passage of a book, the user may want to quickly dive into the full book (not just the passage), and then to create a new card at the end of their reading session so they can continue reading from where they left off later. If a card represents an idea from my notes, I\u0026rsquo;d like to be able to read the surrounding notes in my note taking software, where I\u0026rsquo;m best able to engage with the ideas.\nGetting each of these domains right in a single app (or through clean interactions with other systems) seems like a difficult challenge, but potentially quite rewarding if done well.\nData Entry I expect the usability of Pico will be a big part of what makes the Pico experience pleasant or not. Data entry and the whole card creation process seems like one of the tricky things to get right. If I want to create cards for studying, based on my notes, then I\u0026rsquo;ll want to be taking those notes in some other software (unless you\u0026rsquo;re also building a Roam / RemNote competitor too!). Going from this other software into Pico can be challenging because there are many possible \u0026ldquo;other softwares\u0026rdquo; that people could be coming from and many possible formats people could be taking notes in.\nFor the book reading case, the experience I would want would be that when I\u0026rsquo;m reading a PDF or eBook a card is automatically created for each book I\u0026rsquo;ve opened, that is automatically kept up to date with the part of the book that I\u0026rsquo;m up to.\nOverwhelmed by Cards This thought comes from my inexperience with spaced-repetition software systems. It seems like with traditional spaced repetition algorithms, it can be easy to get overwhelmed by a backlog of cards to review if you take a few days (or heavens forbid a week!) off of review.\nLately I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing spaced repetition in Roam Research using an adhoc system I threw together for myself using Browserflow. Instead of having specific days on which to review cards, they get reviewed in a specific review session. If I skip a day, all future review sessions just come a day later; the backlog doesn\u0026rsquo;t grow.\nMotivation Pico is a method for spending your time with intention. This is fantastic!\nMy understanding of the \u0026ldquo;Principles of Pico\u0026rdquo; are:\n Spend less time on things you don\u0026rsquo;t want to be doing (Facebook, Twitter, etc) Spend more time on things you do want Use external mechanisms and automation to guide you toward these good uses of time Use gamification to increase time spent on these productive uses of time Learn from experience what works and what doesn\u0026rsquo;t Reengage with your own ideas using spaced repetition Reengage with people using spaced repetition Learn things via spaced repetition  I\u0026rsquo;m 100% on board with these principles and am very excited to see where Pico lands a year from now.\nHeads up that I wrote most of this snippet back on March 14, 2020, and then only finished it up and published it today December 20, 2020. So, forgive the delay and let\u0026rsquo;s continue the conversation some time in the next ten months.\nCheers.\n","date":1584144000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584144000,"objectID":"56b026c2f033274622b57573b18d3101","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-03-14-principles-of-pico/","publishdate":"2020-03-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2020-03-14-principles-of-pico/","section":"snippets","summary":"Here\u0026rsquo;s an attempt at capturing and organizing my thoughts on Pico, from our conversation about it March.\nFirst, an attempt at an overview of the Pico system.\nOverview You enter cards through a variety of sources.

Cards can also be created from your contacts list.\nThen, Pico shows you these cards in an Anki-meets-Tinder swipe-based spaced repetition manner.","tags":["attention","spaced-repetition"],"title":"Principles of Pico","type":"snippets"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Aaron Mayer aims to listen to 100 audiobooks in a single month. He intends to listen to these audiobooks at 2x - 3x speed. Intense!\nFor the last few weeks, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on automatic video editing tools. And one of the core features I\u0026rsquo;ve been working with is automatic speed adjustments to videos to eliminate silent airtime and make the videos more engaging. This seems like a perfect fit for Aaron\u0026rsquo;s challenge.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve adapted this tooling into a new tool I\u0026rsquo;m calling Fastbook. It accepts audiobooks in the form of .wav files, and can apply speed adjustments to the silence and the spoken word independently, even removing silence entirely if desired.\nIf Aaron can already comfortably (with great focus) listen to a book at 2.5x speed, he can listen to a 10 hour book in 4 hours. If 20% of that book is actually silence, then the 10 hour book becomes an 8 hour book with silence removed, and the total listen time drops to just 3h12. I think 20% may actually be a conservative estimate for silent time, though it will vary from narrator to narrator.\nEstimating 45 minutes saved per book, this tool can save over 3 days total time across 100 books. Or, alternatively, Aaron could drop the playback speed down from 2.5x to 2x without increasing his total listening time at all, but potentially helping out his comprehension substantially.\nThis tool wont be appropriate for all audiobook listeners. For many, the silences matter, and removing them would degrade the quality of the book. For many, listening at 2.5x would also degrade the quality of the book. So use this tool with caution.\nFor those of you who are intersted, however, here\u0026rsquo;s how to use Fastbook.\nInstalling Fastbook I\u0026rsquo;ve made Fastbook available for free on GitHub. You can access it here.\nTo use it, save it to your computer as fastbook.py.\nNext, make sure you have all the dependencies installed. See the dependencies section for what is required.\nPre-work: Converting Your Book to .wav You need your audiobook in wav format to use Fastbook.\nTo convert an audiobook to wav, use ffmpeg.\nInstall ffmpeg. Then, run ffmpeg -i book.aax book.wav to convert an Audible audiobook to a wav file. There may be an additional step if your aax file is DRM protected.\nUsing Fastbook Now you can use Fastbook like this:\npython fastbook.py \\ --audio_path=/path/to/book.wav \\ --output_path=/path/to/book-fast.wav \\ --loud_speed=1 \\ --quiet_speed=5  --audio_path should point to an existing wav file that you downloaded or generated in the pre-work section. --output_path is the path to the file that Fastbook will generate. Finally, --loud_speed is how much to speed up the normal spoke text of the book by, and --quiet_speed is how much to speed up the silence in the book by. You can remove silence by setting --quiet_speed=99999 or any other similiarly large number.\nDependencies Here are the dependencies you need to use Fastbook.\nFirst, you need Python 3. You can follow these instructions to set up Python 3 if you don\u0026rsquo;t already have it installed.\nThen, you need these Python depenencies: fire, scipy, tqdm, numpy, and audiotsm. Install these with pip install fire scipy tqdm numpy audiotsm or use your favorite Python package manager.\nFinally, to do the pre-work, you will likely need ffmpeg. Installation instructions are available here.\nRead quick! I recommend for Aaron to use the default speed settings of --loud_speed=1 --quiet_speed=5. This wont eliminate the silence entirely, but will reduce the audio time considerably. Then, for the remaining speed-up, I suggest using whatever media player you were already using, such as VLC which supports arbitrary speed adjustments in real time.

Auto Auto-Jumpcutter has two \u0026ldquo;auto\u0026quot;s in its name because jumpcutter already does automatic jumpcutting of videos, and Auto Auto-Jumpcutter uses watchdog to automatically apply jumpcutter the moment a screen recording is captured.\nThe result is that my typing appears superhuman in speed, but slows down while I\u0026rsquo;m speaking, without me needing to do any manual editing to the video to achieve this effect.\nAuto-Commit I also made for myself a git auto-committer. Every time I save a file during a screen recording session, the change is immediately and automatically committed. The commit message is selected automatically from the diff. The result is that I have a timestamped log of all changes made during the recording. This is super useful for editing the recordings (both automatically and manually) because I can pinpoint exactly where in the recording any change took place. It also works hand-in-hand with the next piece of tooling.\nKeyboard Shortcuts Just using Auto Auto-Jumpcutter goes a long way toward having automatically edited videos, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t completely eliminate the need for manual editing. For example, it provides no way to do multiple takes and stitch together the good parts of each. For this I\u0026rsquo;ve set up a keyboard shortcut system for myself using the Python keyboard module. This way I can indicate via keyboard shortcuts to remove a selection of footage during the recording session, and have it automatically be removed during the automatic editing phase. This last step \u0026ndash; using the keyboard shortcuts to guide automatic editing \u0026ndash; is an active work in progress.\n","date":1582675200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582675200,"objectID":"ea02fe603b92ce0066ce2b46885822cb","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-02-26-video-tooling-progress/","publishdate":"2020-02-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2020-02-26-video-tooling-progress/","section":"snippets","summary":"Over the last week and a half I\u0026rsquo;ve been making screen recordings of myself programming.

External Monitor: I purchased an external monitor. This made a huge difference. Now I can manage video-editing tools, a terminal, a browser, etc on one screen, while keeping the contents of the video (the editor and public terminal) on the other screen and recording it.\n   carykh/jumpcutter: This tool can automatically speed up the silent parts of a video, resulting in shorter less-boring videos.\n  Mac Screen Capture: cmd-shift-5 lets you capture video on Mac. You can choose what directory the captured video is saved to. Before I discovered this, I used QuickTime, but this is easier to use.\n  Using watchdog This is a Python module that can monitor your filesystem and trigger an action when files are created or modified. I use it to a) automatically rename video files as they\u0026rsquo;re created, and b) to automatically apply jumpcutting to new captured videos. The filename format I use is YYYY-MM-DD-screen-recording-###.mov.\n  Python Fire: The first twenty clips I recorded (not released) were all of me building the tooling I now use as I record videos. Most of this tooling lives in Python Fire CLIs. These CLIs let me do things like composite audio, perform auto-jumpcutting, and rename videos.\n  Things to improve:   Zoom in! The code is blurry and small and the video as is needs to be watched at 1080p to look OK, which is silly.\n  Audio Quality I have a lapel mic I\u0026rsquo;m using for new recordings and it helps.\n  Storytelling Is a Python Fire CLI for adding and subtracting the most compelling story?

In box A is either $1 million or 0, in box B there is $1000.\nYou\u0026rsquo;re told, choose either just box A or both A and B.\nYou keep the contents of the boxes you choose. Also, the host knows what box you will choose, and has placed $1 million in A if you will choose only A, and $0 in A if you will choose both A and B.\nSome contestants, faced with this choice, would choose both A and B. They reason that since the money has already been placed, choosing A and B is guaranteed to yield $1000 more than choosing just A. Others would choose only A, since per the host\u0026rsquo;s plans this option leads to a significantly better payout.\nClearly choosing only A is $1000 worse than choosing both A and B, yet choosing A only is allegedly better given the host\u0026rsquo;s foresight. These statements appear contradictory, and this situation is known as Newcomb\u0026rsquo;s Paradox. How can we reconcile these two true but contradictory statements?\nWe do so by clarifying:\n Right now choosing only A is $1000 worse than choosing both A and B. However, having a brain1 at the time the money is placed that will lead you to choose only A at the time of choosing gives the $1 million outcome.  Is this something you have control over? Can you decide at the time the money is placed to have a brain that will lead you to later choose only box A?\nYes.\nIt may seem like no, for a few reasons:\n You didn\u0026rsquo;t even know there was a choice to make. You surely don\u0026rsquo;t get to make choices about how your brain works, right? Since the host is able know your choice ahead of time, that must mean it\u0026rsquo;s predetermined, right?  However, none of these reasons are entirely valid.\nFirst, it\u0026rsquo;s true that at the time the money is placed, you didn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily know you had a choice to make. You hadn\u0026rsquo;t yet been informed that you would later be on this gameshow. However, it\u0026rsquo;s possible you considered the situation as a hypothetical anyway (maybe while reading a blog post, for instance). It isn\u0026rsquo;t necessary that you considered precisely the situation that you would later find yourself in, only that you\u0026rsquo;ve given conscious deliberate thought to the way you make choices. By thinking this through, you can decide now whether you have a brain that would later choose box A or one that would later choose both A and B, should the gameshow situation ever arise.\nNext, you absolutely do get to make choices about how your brain works. You can choose when to sleep, when to study, what substances to ingest, and most importantly, what to focus your attention on. All of these levers are yours to pull, and they all affect how your brain will operate in the future.\nAt the time you choose the boxes, it\u0026rsquo;s still your decision as to which box(es) to choose. (In the sense that it\u0026rsquo;s your brain that produces the decision.) But you must have been predictable, at least to the host, for them to have predicted what choice you would later make. (Nothing wrong with being predictable!)\nHow is it that you were predictable? Does this require determinism? One extreme way you may have been predictable is if the host knows exactly how events will play out, right down to the thoughts you will have and the choices you will make.\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be quite so extreme though. The host only claimed to have roughly one bit of information about you and the future: what binary choice you would make when confronted with the box dilemma. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t require omniscience. The host may have no idea what the weather is going to be the next day, as long as they\u0026rsquo;re able to predict whether or not you\u0026rsquo;re taking box B.\nSo maybe they know a little about how your mind works, or they\u0026rsquo;ve read something you\u0026rsquo;ve posted online that lets them conclude how you will handle the box situation.\nYou must consider that whatever they know, they knew it at the time that they chose how to fill the boxes. (They likely also knew it at the time they chose to host the gameshow in the first place.)\nWhat I think is most likely is that this host does know precisely how you think about this choice. They do this by understanding to a very high degree of precision how your brain is going to cope with the decision of which boxes to choose. Think of the host as a very skilled poker player, that can read you like a book. Instead of just knowing whether you\u0026rsquo;re bluffing or not, they know what you\u0026rsquo;re going to think before you even think it. It\u0026rsquo;s like weather forecasting, but instead of understanding the atmosphere, they\u0026rsquo;re understanding you.\nAnd like with weather forecasting, their model is imperfect. It\u0026rsquo;s good enough to know what box you\u0026rsquo;ll choose, with certainty, but only because that only requires forecasting a small window (a week, let\u0026rsquo;s say) into the future. Like the atmospheric conditions that determine the weather, your brain is a chaotic system. Any imperfection in the model, however small, will eventually blow up and lead to large errors in the model in the future. So our host can\u0026rsquo;t model your every thought a year into the future, let alone e.g. the whole population\u0026rsquo;s behaviors.\nSo what boxes should you choose?\nYou should choose to open just box A. By reaching this conclusion (and more importantly, by adopting the strategy for reasoning that leads to this conclusion), you guarantee yourself $1 million the next time you encounter a wealthy generous time travelling gameshow host interested in philosophy and mathematics.\n  I say \u0026ldquo;brain\u0026rdquo;, but I really mean the whole of your situation and life circumstances. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1581120000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581120000,"objectID":"c9afce39bad6f3ad11fd9aeb1160c67c","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-02-08-future-gameshow-host/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2020-02-08-future-gameshow-host/","section":"snippets","summary":"A gameshow host reveals 2 boxes, box A and box B.

You\u0026rsquo;ll notice it\u0026rsquo;s in the snippets section of the website, rather than part of the main blog. This gives me the freedom to post it even though I know it\u0026rsquo;s not as polished as it could be.\nNow that this first pass is published, it\u0026rsquo;s time to start thinking about where to go next with Ask Me Anywhere.\nShort Term: Stylistic Improvements On mobile, the \u0026ldquo;Click to React\u0026rdquo; text shows up and is improperly styled. I didn\u0026rsquo;t intend for it to show up at all. On certain mobile devices and browsers, it seems there are even larger issues than this, such as double tapping sometimes not working at all. Let me know if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work with your browser so I can fix it.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Click to React\u0026rdquo; text also sometimes causes the flow of the text to change, which interrupts the reading experience somewhat. I would like to fix this so that the text flow is never changed by the presence of this message.\nI also would like to tweak the styling to minimize the friction someone feels in deciding to leave a message. I think adding a question-mark icon, which when moused-over gives an explanation of why this feature is there in the first place could be useful. This could strike a good balance between being non-intrusive and letting people know that their thoughts are warmly welcomed.\nLonger Term: \u0026ldquo;Socratic Tutorials\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Ask Me Anywhere\u0026rdquo; is really an MVP that came out of a larger idea: \u0026ldquo;Socratic Tutorials\u0026rdquo;.\nMy idea is that a Socratic Tutorial is a blog post structured in a very particular way. It begins with a brief introduction to a topic, followed by a series of questions you might want to ask about that topic. Click a question to reveal an answer to that question, followed by additional questions you might have about the topic. In this way, you can explore the contents of the post in the order that best suits your interests. I also hope that by having to click questions to view the answers, it will help motivate what you\u0026rsquo;re reading, since you\u0026rsquo;ll be actively wondering about the question when you read the response.\nIf a reader of a Socratic Tutorial doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand something, or has a question that isn\u0026rsquo;t already addressed, they can choose to ask that question. The author can then add it to the list of questions available during reading if they choose to do so. In that way, \u0026ldquo;Ask Me Anywhere\u0026rdquo; is almost a subset of the features planned for Socratic Tutorials.\nMy very first blog post ever was about Collapsible Blog Posts. The premise was that you could click on a paragraph, and it would be replaced with a summary of that paragraph. This paragraph is an example; click on it, and it will be replaced with a summary. This was a Collapsible Blog Post paragraph. Click to un-collapse. I learned early on from this experiment that the reverse process actually is more useful. Present the user with a short summary, and let them click if they want to read additional details.\nHere's an example of a short paragraph that you can click to reveal additional details. The reason it makes more sense to show the summary first is that it empowers the user to choose how to spend their time. If they are interested in understanding more about a topic, they can choose to expand the paragraph and read the details. If instead they read the extended paragraph first, there isn't much value to them also reading the summarized version. And if they just want the summarized version, having them see the full version first isn't too useful either. In some ways the idea for \u0026ldquo;Socratic Tutorials\u0026rdquo; is a spiritual descendent of Collapsible Blog Posts. They both share a goal: give the user control over the information they\u0026rsquo;re consuming, as they\u0026rsquo;re reading. Socratic Tutorials and Ask Me Anywhere take an additional step though, giving the user the ability to communicate directly with the author while they\u0026rsquo;re reading.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll likely have noticed that this post uses \u0026ldquo;Ask Me Anywhere\u0026rdquo;. That means you can double click any paragraph, or click between two paragraphs, in order to send a note directly to the author.

I also think this data would tell a fascinating story.\nFor example, one plot that I think would be compelling would be person-hours-per-year spent thinking about physics plotted as a function of time over the last 100 years, with important physics milestones shown on the same plot (e.g. as a time series plot with events.)\nOne worry with such a visualization is that the population is growing rapidly, and so the interesting story of how humanity\u0026rsquo;s attention has shifted between fields over time may be lost to a visualization that simply shows population growth. It may be necessary to normalize by population to tell such a story.\nIt may seem infeasible to precisely collect this data, as there is no public registry of who is thinking about what. However, I think the data is perhaps more readily available than appears at first blush.\nWhere would the data come from?\n Search trends University enrollments Publication counts Surveys  Search trends are of course a more recent source of data, only going back one or two decades. The pre-1990s version of search trends might be library records, or book sales.\nUniversity enrollments and degrees granted tells a significant story about how many people are studying different areas. You can roughly estimate how much time a student majoring in physics puts into their studies, and if course enrollments are available that estimate can be even more precise.\nScientific fields make their mark on the world by publishing their research. Counting publications can provide an estimate of one piece of humanity\u0026rsquo;s effort studying science.\nFinally, for contemporary data, and maybe even a little historical data, one could uses surveys / polling techniques to estimate where scientific mindshare is going today.\nAmong this data I\u0026rsquo;d be curious to see when historically there have been large swings in mindshare toward a particular topic. Right now, anecdotally, machine learning research is engaging a quickly increasing number of people, including drawing people away from other fields. I\u0026rsquo;d love to see this anecdotal evidence backed up (or refuted) by data. And I expect there are plenty of similar historical precidents that I would be quite interested in learning more about as well.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t forsee collecting this data or performing these visualizations myself in the near future. This post is just an opportunity to think aloud, not a plan for my own action. But if you have data like this, or know of someone who has done a related analysis, I\u0026rsquo;d be quite interested to hear about it.

However, they often fall into the trap of trying to do too much. The best blog posts do one thing, and do it well. If you\u0026rsquo;re writing a blog post, you should choose a single, narrow point that you want to make, and make it well.\nWhile this may seem like obviously good advice, in practice the temptation to broaden the scope of a blog post can be very real. So it is important to actively practice discretion in limiting the scope of any post.\nHow does scope creep come about? Authors may have a temptation to write about tangentially related topics. Sometimes this will be in order to provide justification or context. Other times the author simply has multiple lessons on the same topic they wish to share.\nAny one of these scenarios will lead the author to increase the scope of their writing. Even in the face of these situations, however, it is important to keep a narrow scope.\nIn this post, for example, the core message is that \u0026ldquo;when writing a blog post, you should have a narrowly scoped thesis.\u0026rdquo; It is tempting for me to then also write about how to choose that thesis. After all, this seems a natural discussion to have while explaining the importance of a narrow scope. However, this would be a dangerous move, because a good discussion about how to choose a thesis well requires giving advice like \u0026ldquo;ask yourself: what are you interested in and knowledgeable about?\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;think about what your audience is likely to care about\u0026rdquo;, etc. These suggestions don\u0026rsquo;t help make the core point, that your scope should be exceedingly narrow.\nIn writing this post, it is tempting to write about how \u0026ldquo;trying to do too much can lead to doing multiple things poorly\u0026rdquo; applies in other, non-writing, contexts too. This has the potential to be an insightful discussion. However, this would only serve to detract from the main point: in writing blog posts specifically, you should choose a single main point and make it well. Trying to broaden this to other contexts would weaken the argument, because the wider the context is, the more exceptions there are. If I had said \u0026ldquo;in all of life, do one thing and do it well\u0026rdquo;, people would correctly protest: that\u0026rsquo;s no way to live a life, you should aim to be well-rounded. So, I strengthen my argument by narrowing its scope: in writing a blog post, pick a single thesis and defend it convincingly.\nWhy is it important to have just one main point? To start, having a single well defined main point improves the clarity of your writing. It is easier to be persuasive when you have a well-defined objective you are trying to impress upon your readers. Stray too far from this main point and it distracts the reader and weakens your piece.\nIn the age of online writing and sharing, the importance of a single clear thesis is increased. Having a well-scoped piece increases its sharability. There is no risk that the recipient of the shared article will mistake the reason for its sharing. Having a well-scoped piece also makes it easier to reference that piece in the future. One can simply link to the article if they want to leverage its argument, rather than needing to specify \u0026ldquo;in the third section of David\u0026rsquo;s piece on online writing\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nAdditionally readers have limited time and attention. So, don\u0026rsquo;t bury the lead. Don\u0026rsquo;t make readers have to dig deep to uncover a point that can be stated succinctly. Show your readers your respect for their time and attention by making your point immediately clear. Then they can make an informed choice about whether they\u0026rsquo;d like to learn more. It\u0026rsquo;s their time. Don\u0026rsquo;t trick them with ambiguous or click-bait headlines. Let them invest it well by telling them upfront what it is you want to convince them of.\nOf course there are exceptions to the rule. For educational pieces, teaching a curriculum of topics, it may be appropriate to have multiple lessons. And if you\u0026rsquo;re writing for literary value, then the core takeaway may not be the central reason for your writing. In the general case though, critical for the vast majority of blogs being written today, it is wise to stick to a single thesis. State it clearly and defend it well.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve learned just one thing from this article, it\u0026rsquo;s that the best articles should leave you with just one thing to learn.\n","date":1578960000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578960000,"objectID":"afc7d52e8d205bca0cbb24b7c6e21b27","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-01-14-say-one-thing-well/","publishdate":"2020-01-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2020-01-14-say-one-thing-well/","section":"snippets","summary":"When writing a blog post, have a single clear message and convey it convincingly.","tags":null,"title":"Say One Thing Well","type":"snippets"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Background: Writing is Hard Sometimes I find writing feels easy \u0026ndash; e.g. when writing for no audience, when writing something you\u0026rsquo;ve already thought extensively about, when telling a story in a logical order that you\u0026rsquo;re deeply familiar with. Other times, I find writing very difficult.\nWhen I\u0026rsquo;m writing a paper, I am writing explicitly for an audience, the story is not always clear immediately, and the material is something I\u0026rsquo;m becoming familiar with over time, not something about which I\u0026rsquo;m already deeply familiar. So, I find paper writing hard.\nI have an idea that I think will help me write more effectively. It\u0026rsquo;s a software tool that structures the time you spend writing. I\u0026rsquo;ll describe the tool, but I don\u0026rsquo;t anticipate building it. Perhaps we can come up with a low-resource version of this idea, e.g. with paper and pencil, that I can try even without building this tool.\nThe Writing System The tool presents you with a prompt, a textbox, and a timer.\nThe initial prompt is \u0026ldquo;What do you want to write about?\u0026rdquo;, and the initial timer is for 5 minutes. Subsequent prompts will be determined from what you\u0026rsquo;ve entered in the past.\nIn the textbox, you are encouraged to respond to the prompt.\nAs part of your response, you can issue some commands / keywords. If you start a line with ! or ?, then that line will get used as a future prompt. You can specify the relative importance of a future prompt by including a priority. This will determine the order in which you are presented with the prompts. E.g. !0 is highest priority, and so such a line will become the next prompt you receive, unless there are other priority 0 prompts already queued up.\n! \u0026lt;topic\u0026gt; is short for \u0026ldquo;\u0026lt;topic\u0026gt; is a topic I want to write about later\u0026rdquo; ? \u0026lt;question\u0026gt; is short for \u0026ldquo;\u0026lt;question\u0026gt; is a question I want to answer later\u0026rdquo;\nThere should also be a way to indicate \u0026ldquo;\u0026lt;topic\u0026gt; is a topic I\u0026rsquo;ll need to do more research on\u0026rdquo;, and then for one of the prompts to be about spending time researching a topic, rather than writing about it. Then the next prompt may be to write about what you just learned in the research section.\nOther available commands include:\n :pause to stop the timer :unpause to start the timer again :extend to add additional time to the timer :next to skip to the next prompt  The system is easily extensible, so a writer with a programming background can easily add new commands, or modify the logic that determines when prompts are shown and when breaks are taken. A programming-proficient writer will also have programmatic access to everything they write, as well as the corresponding prompts and metadata.\nOnce the timer reaches 0, a short break is initiated, and then the next prompt is revealed.\nThe idea is to move quickly, and get all your thoughts onto the page, without getting bogged down in a DFS traversal of information about a single line of the overall text.\nAdditional details Every keystroke is logged, so if you write something, and then switch to a new version of it, you will still be able to see the original version. No need to worry about pasting in a password though, since the keylogging data is readily accessible in a plaintext format and you can edit it directly e.g. if anything sensitive does leak in.\nThis system has a decent amount of overlap with the shh shell project that I\u0026rsquo;ve already built, and perhaps a version of this new idea could be easily added to the shh shell. Alternatively, the shh-shell could be forked to build this new system.\nCalendar integration would be cool, so that it times your prompts nicely if you have a meeting coming up so you get to a good break point in time for your meeting.\nImplementation Thoughts I\u0026rsquo;d like to build this onto an existing text editor, rather than writing my own. E.g. using Google Docs would be good. However, the disadvantage of this is that it makes the keystroke logging feature more difficult. Fortunately, Google Docs does have good history tracking. Google Docs also provides good programmatic access. So, an agent running in the background while you write could be taking periodic snapshots too. Such an agent could also be extracting the commands and prompts you write.\nHowever, it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to execute the commands immediately, the way shh shell does. For some commands this may be a real disadvantage.\nI also like the idea of the agent giving the prompts being Bieber Bot \u0026ndash; that is, being the same being as my personal digital assistant. I can picture it asking me \u0026ldquo;you\u0026rsquo;ve been writing continuously for over an hour; is it time for a break?\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;it looks like you stopped writing abruptly there, did you get distracted?\u0026rdquo;.\nInitial Experimentation I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying the idea out in a low-tech way (manually timing things, manually looking up what the next prompt should be).\nHere is the main issue I\u0026rsquo;ve seen so far in the first half hour of testing. When the time runs out for a prompt, I\u0026rsquo;m still in the middle of the prompt. I\u0026rsquo;ve usually started expounding on some idea relevant to the prompt, and there are actually several ideas remaining that I haven\u0026rsquo;t even started exploring for the prompt yet. So what should have happened / what should I do next time? Maybe I could have done a higher level discussion of the prompt and made new future sub-prompts along the way. Or at the end of a section, I could have the system give me a bit of time to create sub-prompts of things I\u0026rsquo;d like to address in the section but didn\u0026rsquo;t get to.\nI could see having a limited time to create new prompts be a good forcing function for coming up with structured high level thinking after a moderate amount of time of lower level writing. So in my next round of testing, I\u0026rsquo;ll try this, and continue to iterate on the idea.\n","date":1578873600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578873600,"objectID":"b4fb9d74a171145aed97ecfca68f582f","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-01-13-writing-tool-idea/","publishdate":"2020-01-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2020-01-13-writing-tool-idea/","section":"snippets","summary":"A structured question-asking tool may be useful for writing effectively.","tags":["attention","taking-silly-ideas-seriously"],"title":"Writing Assistant Tool Idea","type":"snippets"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Long ago (2013) I spent a summer interning at Khan Academy. Also long ago (2014) Harvest and I built a tool for creating educational videos online, in the browser ( Teach Everyone; warning, bit rot ahead).\nToday, I want to see these two methodologies combined.\nI want it to become common practice that after you spend significant time learning something online, you make a quick-and-dirty video explaining what you just learned.\nThe Vision Imagine you\u0026rsquo;ve just completed a series of organic chemistry lessons on Khan Academy. The KA website pops up a modal recommending that you \u0026ldquo;Make a video teaching what you learned to help solidify your understanding of Organic Chemistry!\u0026rdquo;.\nYou click through to a browser based video creation tool \u0026ndash; a cross between Google Slides, Illustrator / Teach Everyone, and OBS / a video editor. In minutes, you\u0026rsquo;re able to assemble a video teaching the material you\u0026rsquo;ve spent the last hours or days wrapping your head around.\nYou combine text, images, drawings, video, and audio to create your video. And when you\u0026rsquo;re done, you have the option to save it privately, share it on YouTube or social media, or to make it visible to others studying the same subject.\nBenefits There are two main benefits from this approach.\n You get to learn by teaching.  Teaching is a super effective way to:\n Reinforce the material so that you remember it longer Help you notice gaps in your understanding and fill them in  So by preparing this little video after spending all that time learning, you\u0026rsquo;ll be left with a better and longer lasting understanding of the material.\nOthers can learn from you  Often times the best teachers are those who remember what it\u0026rsquo;s like not to understand. Since you\u0026rsquo;ve just gone through the process of learning the material, you know exactly which parts were difficult to grasp and what it took for you to grasp them. So your video may end up helping others more than the KA videos in some cases!\nVideo Creation Tool This post isn\u0026rsquo;t a design doc, but I will briefly sketch out what I imagine for the video creation tool.\nThe main interface is a video preview above a timeline, similar to what you would see in Davinci Resolve or any professional video editing tool. You additionally have the option to create clips.\nYou can create clips from text, images, KA-style drawings, audio, or video. Importantly, you can record audio and video clips, or create a KA-style drawing, directly in your browser.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve created some clips, you can position them both in time (on the timeline), and in space (on the video preview).\nI intend to write more about the details of this vision for video creation tool at a later point, but for now the most important thing about it is that it prioritizes being quick to use over being fully featured and professional, and that it can be used directly in the browser. This way it can be used by online learners as part of their online learning experience.\nAdditional Notes My main premise is that students, young and old, should have a light-weight way to create educational videos immediately after learning something online.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve framed this discussion around a hypothetical tool for students to use on Khan Academy, but it applies equally well to educational videos on YouTube and elsewhere. Teach Everyone was an early prototype showing that you can create Khan Academy style animated drawings (i.e. virtual writing on a blackboard) with accompanying audio directly in the browser. Since then, Teach Everyone has suffered some bit rot and unfortunately isn\u0026rsquo;t operational today. However, I\u0026rsquo;m hopeful that some new project will step up, and provide an even better in-browser experience for educational video creation. And then beyond that, I\u0026rsquo;m hopeful that this tool becomes common place for students to use as part of their everyday online learning routine.\nIf you want to discuss these ideas, don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to get in touch: david810+learning-by-teaching@gmail.com.\n","date":1578528000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578528000,"objectID":"4c963c7056adfee11d2d0b7723f209be","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-01-09-learning-by-teaching/","publishdate":"2020-01-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2020-01-09-learning-by-teaching/","section":"snippets","summary":"One of the best ways to learn is to teach.","tags":null,"title":"Learning by Teaching in Online Education","type":"snippets"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\u0026ldquo;Ordinary Least Squares\u0026rdquo; regression, or OLS for short, is a method for finding a best-fit line, given a set of data points.

I could put high quality posts on the main site, and a whole range of both good and bad posts in the snippets section. This way, assuming I do a good job, readers could come to expect that any post on the main website would be high quality. Curious people looking for additional content could come here to the snippets section if they wanted to, but more often posts here would either (1) almost never get read, or (2) be linked to directly, e.g. if they were relevent in some other context.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been surprised and delighted by the effect that having this \u0026ldquo;No Audience\u0026rdquo; section of the website has had on my writing. Writing for no one is so much easier than writing for someone.\nOn a few occasions (and it\u0026rsquo;s only been a few days since I started this section), I\u0026rsquo;ve started writing snippets intending for them to be brief thoughts meant for no one but myself. Then, after starting, it has felt natural to expand the post into something more substantial than I originally intended, e.g. answering questions that a hypothetical reader might have.\nOn one occasion I even decided to bump the post up in importance after getting started, placing it in the main section of the website rather than relegating it to the mostly hidden snippets section.\nTo anyone out there who does end up reading this, and there may very well be none of you: if you\u0026rsquo;re having trouble getting started with writing, write for no audience.\n The Different Degrees of \u0026ldquo;No Audience\u0026rdquo; I actually write for No Audience in two different contexts.\n(1) The snippets section of my website\n(2) Using shh-shell at night\nThe snippets section of my website is public, but with no built-in broadcasting. People can read it if they choose to, but I\u0026rsquo;m not putting it in people\u0026rsquo;s faces (by default; I will if it\u0026rsquo;s appropriate in context). Contrast this with the writing I do with the shh-shell. This is more personal writing that I do half-asleep as I drift off at night, and so I don\u0026rsquo;t make it public; I expect almost no one will ever read it. This writing, I suppose is for No Audience to an even more extreme degree. I recommend both practices: public writing for no audience, and private writing for no audience.\nSocial Media Doesn\u0026rsquo;t Cut It Now that I\u0026rsquo;ve discovered this practice and am quite fond of it, I think it could be a promising addition to social media.\nNo social media platform, to my knowledge, has given people a place to write public posts with an option to publish but not share them. The absense of such a feature makes sense; social media platforms need you to share for them to succeed, so how would giving you a space to publish-but-not-share help them? The answer lies in the psychology of the many social-media lurkers. There is a significant market segment of people who perhaps consume, but do not post, on social media. An option to publish-but-not-broadcast might help to convert some of that segment into sharers.\nAs a social media consumer, but infrequent producer, I can tell you I am hesitant even to Like something on Twitter, because I know Twitter often treats Likes like Retweets, and will put the content I hearted in front of my followers with my name attached, and that\u0026rsquo;s not something I want.\nIf a feature for publishing-without-sharing were added to Facebook or Twitter, perhaps others would have an experience like mine over the last few days. Having the option to publish-but-not-share has significantly reduced the barrier to start writing for me. Then, once I\u0026rsquo;ve started writing, I\u0026rsquo;ve often changed my mind and decided I want to share what I\u0026rsquo;ve written after all.\nIf other social-media lurkers are like me, a feature enabling this behavior could help \u0026ldquo;break the ice\u0026rdquo; so to speak, and could make social media platforms more relevant to them.\nNext Steps I\u0026rsquo;m going to continue building this snippets section for myself, with the default behavior being no-broadcasting as I add snippets. For snippets I\u0026rsquo;m fond of, I may choose to broadcast (e.g. by posting about the post on social media). Contrast this with the main posts section of my website; for new posts there, I will generally always broadcast the post, at least a little bit.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to receive such broadcasts, e.g. when I write a post that I\u0026rsquo;m particularly keen on sharing, please consider subscribing:\n#mc_embed_signup{ background:#fff; clear:left; font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; }  Email Address           (function($) {window.fnames = new Array(); window.ftypes = new Array();fnames[0]='EMAIL';ftypes[0]='email';fnames[1]='FNAME';ftypes[1]='text';fnames[2]='LNAME';ftypes[2]='text';fnames[3]='ADDRESS';ftypes[3]='address';fnames[4]='PHONE';ftypes[4]='phone';fnames[5]='BIRTHDAY';ftypes[5]='birthday';}(jQuery));var $mcj = jQuery.noConflict(true); Ironically, you are also welcome to follow the snippets section with RSS. Don\u0026rsquo;t tell me if you do though, since I would like to continue to feel like I\u0026rsquo;m writing for No Audience.

Really exciting! This is rich data, from which I think I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to learn a lot and hopefully combat unwanted distractions.\nFirst let me describe what information is available, and how you can access it. Then, let\u0026rsquo;s discuss what you can do with this data. As I\u0026rsquo;ve written about previously [1] [2], I already have a chat bot system in place, which will be able to take advantage of this data to e.g. help me stay focused.\nAccessing Your Browser History Thank you to GitHub user dropmeaword for compiling this gist explaining how to access your browser history via sqlite3. The gist covers Safari, Chrome, and Firefox. In this post, I\u0026rsquo;ll just focus on Chrome on OSX, since that\u0026rsquo;s my primary mode of browsing.\nMy Chrome browsing history is located at ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History. Since I use multiple profiles in Chrome, each profile gets its own browsing history, e.g. located at ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Profile 1/History.\nEach browsing history is stored as a sqlite3 database. Before analyzing the data, I recommend making a copy of it (cp ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History my-history); this way your history database (a) wont be locked by Chrome while you\u0026rsquo;re trying to access it, and (b) wont change while you\u0026rsquo;re looking at it, which could cause confusion and inconsistencies in your results.\nThis means you can browse it interactively using the sqlite3 REPL by running sqlite3 PATH_TO_DATABASE.\nThere are also libraries available for accessing sqlite3 databases in just about every language. For Python, there\u0026rsquo;s the sqlite3 library. Go has go-sqlite3. JavaScript has this sqlite3 module. However you most like scripting, you\u0026rsquo;ll have a familiar way of accessing the data.\nThe Available Data Running sqlite3 macro .tables, we see the following tables are available.\n          downloads meta urls   downloads_slices segment_usage visit_source   downloads_url_chains segments visits   keyword_search_terms typed_url_sync_metadata     We\u0026rsquo;ll be most interested in the urls and visits tables.\nThe urls table has these columns (found with .schema urls):\n   Column Type Description     id Integer Id The id of the URL in the database.   url Text The URL of the website.   title Text The title of website.   visit_count Integer The number of times you\u0026rsquo;ve visited the URL.   typed_count Integer The number of times you\u0026rsquo;ve visited the URL by typing in the address (as opposed to by following a link.)   last_visit_time Integer (microseconds since the epoch) The time of the most recent to the URL.   hidden Boolean I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what this is about.    And the visits table has these columns (obtained via .schema visits):\n   Column Type Description     id Integer Id The id of the visit in the database.   url Integer Id The id of the url in the urls table.   visit_time Integer (milliseconds since the epoch) The time of the visit.   from_visit Integer Id The id of the visit that lead you to this one.   transition Bit vector Represents the transition type (how you got to the URL)   segment_id Integer Id The id of the segment in the database. I\u0026rsquo;m not quite sure what a segment is, but there is a segments table you can look at.   visit_duration Integer (microseconds) The amount of time spent at the website, or 0 if not available.   incremented_omnibox_typed_score Boolean I do not know what this is about.    As you can see, we can access every visit to every website that we\u0026rsquo;ve made since the last time we cleared our browsing history. We can see what website we visited (visits.url), when we visited it (visits.visit_time), how many times we\u0026rsquo;ve visited it (urls.visit_count), and how long each visit was for (visits.visit_duration).\nWe can even use visits.from_visit to figure out what website linked us to each url, if that interests us.\nWhat Can We Deduce? We can (1) perform a historical analysis on the data, as well as (2) do real-time monitoring of the data.\nHere I brainstorm some of the historical trends we will be able to uncover:\n Most frequently visited websites Websites where we spend the majority of our time Websites that frequently lead to known-distractor websites (e.g. Reddit, Hacker News, Twitter, YouTube) We can do an analysis by time of day (or day of week), to figure out what sites occupy my time late at night vs during daylight hours.  These are somewhat interesting, but what I\u0026rsquo;m particularly excited for is the ongoing analysis that Bieber Bot can provide by accessing the data.\nHere is a brainstorm of the more real-time actionable insights we might extract from this data.\n Bieber Bot could ping me if it looks like I\u0026rsquo;m spending too much time on a distraction website. He could try to detect if I went to a website with a particular purpose, but ended up getting distracted and not completing the purpose I set out to do.  For example, if I\u0026rsquo;m on a productive website and then switch to a distraction website for more than a few minutes, particularly during work hours, Bieber Bot might message asking if I got distracted. Think you could do that for me Bieber Bot?\n I could signal that I want to view a website later by opening it and immediately closing it again. Perhaps we could detect if I\u0026rsquo;m researching a particular topic, and then Bieber Bot could try to help me with my research.  Related Idea In order to reduce distractions, I\u0026rsquo;d like to be able to switch my browsing mode from \u0026ldquo;clicking opens links\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;clicking saves a link for later\u0026rdquo;. When in this new mode, whenever I click a link it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t open that link; instead, it would save the link to a list of deferred links. Then I would be able to view my \u0026ldquo;saved for later\u0026rdquo; links when I have time that I\u0026rsquo;ve explicitly set aside, rather than during the time that I would rather be doing something more productive.\nNext Steps So far I\u0026rsquo;ve done a little bit of manual exploration of my browsing history data. I\u0026rsquo;ve set up a little Python script to be able to access the data programmatically.\nNext, I\u0026rsquo;ll do more manual analysis, and then I\u0026rsquo;ll see if I\u0026rsquo;m able to give Bieber Bot the real-time access to the data that I described above. I\u0026rsquo;m particularly excited to see if I can get the \u0026ldquo;looks like you\u0026rsquo;ve gotten distracted\u0026rdquo; messages set up with Bieber Bot. As a bonus, since Bieber Bot can message other people too, this system could help me leverage social accountability to stay on task.\nWant to see where this project leads?

There are several pieces to this system, but fortunately it\u0026rsquo;s the kind of system that you can adopt (and discard) incrementally. So, rather than explaining the whole thing in one go, I will explain one core piece in this post.\nIn this post, I will detail how I use a spreadsheet as a daily activity log.\nMy spreadsheet lets me keep a record of all the things I\u0026rsquo;ve done. It then also rolls up this data in interesting ways that help me with reflecting on and planning my life. Finally, it interacts with a bot system I\u0026rsquo;ve written for myself to help me keep my life on track.\nI will answer all of the following questions in this post:\n What\u0026rsquo;s the organizational system? What are the main benefits of this system? Why is this system easy to adopt? Why is this system easy to keep doing for months on end, without forgetting? How does this system help me with planning my life?  The System I have a single spreadsheet with columns Evening, Morning, Keywords, Weekday, Date, People, Notes. In this sheet, I have a single row per day.\nThe essense of the system is to jot down (1) what I do, and optionally (2) who I engage with each day.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t update the spreadsheet every day, usually just once a week or so I\u0026rsquo;ll fill in the activity from all of the missing days.\nThis system serves several purposes, the main one being a journal of sorts so I can see a historical log of my activities. As you\u0026rsquo;ll see in the Planning and Notifications sections, it also helps me remember to regularly do all the activities I enjoy doing.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll start by providing a brief description of each column in the spreadsheet. Then we\u0026rsquo;ll get to discuss how I use the spreadsheet, and you\u0026rsquo;ll see why they\u0026rsquo;re each important to me. We\u0026rsquo;ll then also dive into all the benefits I get from this spreadsheet and the infrastructure I\u0026rsquo;ve built up around it.\nColumn Descriptions    Column Type Description     Evening Text A single cell in which to put the main activity I did in the evening (e.g. after work) on that day.   Morning Optional, Text, infrequently used The main activity I did in the morning (e.g. before work) on that day.   Keywords Optional, comma separated Keywords describing the activities of that day.   Weekday Filled automatically The day of the week, e.g. Thursday   Date Filled automatically The date   People Names, comma separated A list of the people I engaged with on that day   Notes Optional, Text A bit like a diary, this is a place to jot down additional notes about the day.    Really all of the columns are optional, but the ones that are particularly optional are marked as such.\nUsage Now I\u0026rsquo;ll describe the data entry process, and then all the ways I take advantage of this data.\nData Entry About once a week on average I\u0026rsquo;ll go to the spreadsheet, and fill in all the activities I did since the last time I updated the sheet.\nFor each day, I try to capture just the main one to two outside-of-work activities that I engaged in. It\u0026rsquo;s totally fine if I don\u0026rsquo;t capture every little thing, and it\u0026rsquo;s also fine if there are some days that I didn\u0026rsquo;t do anything of note.\nI said above that I do this about once a week, but there\u0026rsquo;s no strong rhythm to it; sometimes I do it every day for multiple consecutive days, and sometimes I\u0026rsquo;ll go multiple weeks between updating the sheet.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been using this system reliably since mid-2018, and it\u0026rsquo;s served me well. The notifications that we\u0026rsquo;ll get to shortly, combined with the simplicity of the method (just one cell to fill in per day), have allowed me to keep using this system without being disrupted by travel or high-workload parts of life.\nPlanning I have a second sheet that is updated automatically using data from the sheet I\u0026rsquo;ve been describing so far. This sheet has one row per activity that I enjoy engaging in.\nThe most important columns in this sheet are:\n   Column Type Description     Category Text The category of the activity (e.g. Athletic).   Activity Text An activity that I enjoy engaging in. (e.g. Skiing)   Last Date Filled automatically The most recent date on which I engaged in the activity.    The Last Date column is filled automatically using the data from the main sheet. The Google Sheets formula that fills in this column is a query a bit like this one:\n=IFERROR(QUERY(scheduled, \u0026quot;select E where A contains '\u0026quot; \u0026amp; C2 \u0026amp; \u0026quot;' OR B contains '\u0026quot; \u0026amp; C2 \u0026amp; \u0026quot;' OR C contains '\u0026quot; \u0026amp; C2 \u0026amp; \u0026quot;' order by E desc limit 1 label E ''\u0026quot; ))   C2 refers to the Activity from the current sheet A is the Evening column from the Data Entry sheet B is the Morning column from the Data Entry sheet C is the Keywords column from the Data Entry sheet E is the Date from the Data Entry sheet  This lets me quickly see, for each activity that I enjoy, how recently I\u0026rsquo;ve done that activity. For example, I see that I haven\u0026rsquo;t gone camping since 2019-07-05, I haven\u0026rsquo;t played tennis since 2018-07-31, and I haven\u0026rsquo;t gone swimming since 2019-10-07. Really overdue for some tennis!\nMy spreadsheet also rolls up this data further, by category. I can quickly see how recently I\u0026rsquo;ve done any activity in a given category.\nThe categories I use are: \u0026ldquo;Athletic\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Civic Something Or Other\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Day Trips\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Educational\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Entertainment\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Family\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Financial\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Food\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Music + Arts\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Outdoorsy\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Personal Projects\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Puzzles\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Social\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Social Games\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;Well being\u0026rdquo;.\nHere you can see how recently I\u0026rsquo;ve done something in each of the categories.\n  As you can see, I\u0026rsquo;m doing a pretty good job of doing most of the categories of activities. When I go to make plans next, I\u0026rsquo;ll most likely schedule activities from the bottom categories. For example, I may do a financial review, schedule a board game night, and plan to attend a City Council meeting.\nNotifications I\u0026rsquo;ve also given Bieber Bot (my digital personal assistant and robot friend) access to this data, and he helps me make better use of it.\nIf it\u0026rsquo;s been too long since I\u0026rsquo;ve scheduled an activity in any particular category, Bieber Bot will message me on FB Messenger reminding me to schedule something in that category.\n  Similarly BieberBot will remind me each day of any upcoming activities planned for that day. And if I don\u0026rsquo;t have any activity planned for a particular day, BieberBot may take the liberty of suggesting an activity.\n  Finally BieberBot will also remind me if I haven\u0026rsquo;t been entering activities into the spreadsheet in a while, so I don\u0026rsquo;t fall too far behind on the logging system.\nSetting up these notifcations is a bit outside the scope of this post, but if it interests you how BieberBot works, you can subscribe for future posts here:\n#mc_embed_signup{ background:#fff; clear:left; font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; }  Email Address           (function($) {window.fnames = new Array(); window.ftypes = new Array();fnames[0]='EMAIL';ftypes[0]='email';fnames[1]='FNAME';ftypes[1]='text';fnames[2]='LNAME';ftypes[2]='text';fnames[3]='ADDRESS';ftypes[3]='address';fnames[4]='PHONE';ftypes[4]='phone';fnames[5]='BIRTHDAY';ftypes[5]='birthday';}(jQuery));var $mcj = jQuery.noConflict(true); You can also learn a bit more about BieberBot here, but there\u0026rsquo;s so much more to be written.\nArchiving Old Events To keep things clean, my spreadsheet also uses Google Apps Script to archive old events.

I use the following:\n   Evening Morning Keywords Weekday Date People Notes    But for just getting started you might be satisfied with something simpler, say just these three columns:\n   Activity Weekday Date    You can use the formula =TEXT(WEEKDAY(E3), \u0026quot;dddd\u0026quot;) to autopopulate the Weekday column, where E3 represents the date (tip: you can use cmd-; to enter today\u0026rsquo;s date into a cell).\nI also create a second sheet called Archive with the same columns as the main sheet, and use the auto-archiving feature mentioned earlier to prevent the main sheet from getting cluttered.\nNext create the analysis sheet with the columns:\n   Category Activity Last Date    The first two columns you can fill in with whatever categories and activities you like, and you can add new categories and activities at any time. No need to fill this in too much until you start to see how you\u0026rsquo;re using the main sheet.\nTo autofill the Last Date column, the full formula I use is:\n=MAX( IFERROR(QUERY(scheduled, \u0026quot;select E where A contains '\u0026quot; \u0026amp; C2 \u0026amp; \u0026quot;' OR B contains '\u0026quot; \u0026amp; C2 \u0026amp; \u0026quot;' or C contains '\u0026quot; \u0026amp; C2 \u0026amp; \u0026quot;' order by E desc limit 1 label E ''\u0026quot; )), IFERROR(QUERY(archive, \u0026quot;select E where A contains '\u0026quot; \u0026amp; C2 \u0026amp; \u0026quot;' OR B contains '\u0026quot; \u0026amp; C2 \u0026amp; \u0026quot;' or C contains '\u0026quot; \u0026amp; C2 \u0026amp; \u0026quot;' order by E desc limit 1 label E ''\u0026quot; )) )  This searches both the main sheet (scheduled) and the archive sheet for the most recent occurrence of each activity (C2). For this to work, the rows in the archive and main sheet need to be in reverse chronological order.\nFinally, to get the roll-up by category, I use the following Google Sheets formula:\n=QUERY(A:E, \u0026quot;select B, max(D), count(B) where B\u0026lt;\u0026gt;'' group by B order by max(D) desc label max(D) 'Last date', count(B) 'Count' \u0026quot;, -1)  Though I would like to, I won\u0026rsquo;t go into how to set up the notifications in this post. For now, that\u0026rsquo;s just between me and BieberBot.\nConclusion As a quick recap of my system: (1) I manually enter the activity(s) I do each day; (2) the spreadsheet automatically figures out how recently I did each category of activity; (3) bonus: BieberBot uses this data to help me keep my life on track.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been using this system for about 18 months now, and I\u0026rsquo;ve been quite happy with the insight it provides and how helpful it is for planning.\nStill, there are many pieces of my system left undiscussed: tracking financial transactions, taking notes on academic papers, staying in touch with friends and colleagues, dealing with social media, and more! I\u0026rsquo;d love to tell you about the rest, so stay tuned. And don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to reach out if you\u0026rsquo;d like to discuss anything you read. I hope you find this useful, and do let me know if you start using a spreadsheet to track your own life or have a system of your own.\n","date":1577577600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577577600,"objectID":"fbc695f7354c14d0b7602af871dee2e8","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/post/2019-12-29-track-your-life-in-a-spreadsheet/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-12-29-track-your-life-in-a-spreadsheet/","section":"post","summary":"I use a daily activity log to track my habits and plan future activities.","tags":["google apps script"],"title":"Keeping Track of My Life in a Spreadsheet","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Today I learned the word \u0026ldquo;feedingstuffs\u0026rdquo;.\nfeedingstuff (countable and uncountable, plural feedingstuffs) Any foodstuff used to feed livestock.

That is, a pair of nodes may be connected by an edge in the first graph if and only if the corresponding pair of nodes in the second graph is also connected by an edge in the same way. An example of two isomorphic graphs is shown here.\nFigure: Graph 1 and Graph 2 are isomorphic. The correspondance between nodes is illustrated by the node colors and numbers.\nIn general, determining whether two graphs are isomorphic when the correspondance is not provided is a challenging problem; precisely how hard this problem is remains an open question in computer science. It isn\u0026rsquo;t known whether there is a polynomial time algorithm for determining whether graphs are isomorphic, and it also isn\u0026rsquo;t known whether the problem is $\\text{NP-complete}.$ The graph isomorphism problem may even be an example of an $\\text{NP-intermediate}$ problem, but this would only be possible if $\\text{P} \\ne \\text{NP}.$\nThe Weisfeiler-Lehman Isomorphism Test Here is the algorithm for the Weisfeiler-Lehman Isomorphism Test. It produces for each graph a canonical form. If the canonical forms of two graphs are not equivalent, then the graphs are definitively not isomorphic. However, it is possible for two non-isomorphic graphs to share a canonical form, so this test alone cannot provide conclusive evidence that two graphs are isomorphic.\nThe Algorithm:\n For iteration $i$ of the algorithm we will be assigning to each node a tuple $L_{i,n}$ containing the node\u0026rsquo;s old compressed label and a multiset of the node\u0026rsquo;s neighbors' compressed labels. A multiset is a set (a collection of elements where order is not important) where elements may appear multiple times. At each iteration we will additionally be assigning to each node $n$ a new \u0026ldquo;compressed\u0026rdquo; label $C_{i,n}$ for that node\u0026rsquo;s set of labels. Any two nodes with the same $L_{i,n}$ will get the same compressed label.   To begin, we initialize $C_{0,n} = 1$ for all nodes $n$. At iteration $i$ of the algorithm (beginning with $i=1$), for each node $n$, we set $L_{i,n}$ to be a tuple containing the node\u0026rsquo;s old label $C_{i-1,n}$ and the multiset of compressed node labels $C_{i-1,m}$ from all nodes $m$ neighboring $n$ from the previous iteration $(i-1)$. We then complete iteration $i$ by setting $C_{i,n}$ to be a new \u0026ldquo;compressed\u0026rdquo; label, such as a hash of $L_{i,n}$. Any two nodes with the same labels $L_{i,n}$ must get the same compressed label $C_{i,n}$. Partition the nodes in the graph by their compressed label. Repeat 2 + 3 for up to $N$ (the number of nodes) iterations, or until there is no change in the partition of nodes by compressed label from one iteration to the next.  When using this method to determine graph isomorphism, it may be applied in parallel to the two graphs. The algorithm may be terminated early after iteration $i$ if the sizes of partitions of nodes partitioned by compressed labels diverges between the two graphs; if this is the case, the graphs are not isomorphic.\nExample of the Weisfeiler-Lehman Isomorphism Test We demonstrate here the Weisfeiler-Lehman isomorphism test using the example graphs from above. The graphs are shown again here for completeness.\nFigure: Graph 1 and Graph 2 are isomorphic. We will apply the Weisfeiler-Lehman isomorphism test to these graphs as a means of illustrating the test.\nTo initialize the algorithm (Step 1), we set $C_{0,n} = 1$ for all nodes $n$.\nFor iteration 1, Step 2, we compute $L_{1,n}$. The first part of a node\u0026rsquo;s $L$ is the node\u0026rsquo;s old compressed label; the second part of a node\u0026rsquo;s $L$ is the multiset of the neighboring nodes' compressed labels.\nFor iteration 1, Step 3, we introduce \u0026ldquo;compressed\u0026rdquo; labels $C_{1,n}$ for the nodes:\nWe now begin iteration 2. In iteration 2, Step 2, we compute $L_{2,n}$:\nIn iteration 2, Step 3, we compute $C_{2,n}$:\nIn iteration 3, Step 2, we compute $L_{3,n}$:\nIn iteration 3, Step 3, we compute $C_{3,n}$:\nSince the partition of nodes by compressed label has not changed from $C_{2,n}$ to $C_{3,n}$, we may terminate the algorithm here.\nConcretely, the partition of nodes by compressed label may be represented as the number of nodes with each compressed label. That is: \u0026ldquo;2 7s, 1 8, and 2 9s\u0026rdquo;. This is the canonical form of our graph. Since both Graph 1 and Graph 2 have this same canonical form, we cannot rule out the possibility that they are isomorphic (they are in fact isomorphic, but the algorithm doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow us to conclude this definitively.)\nImplementation Considerations One detail omitted is that the algorithm requires canonical forms of the multisets for comparison. Placing the elements of the multiset in sorted order provides one way of doing this.\nAdditionally, for the representation of the graph that the algorithm emits to be deterministic, we need to establish a convention for creating compressed labels. One possible convention is to use increasing integers starting from 1, and to assign compressed labels to nodes in lexicographical order of their non-compressed labels. Another possible convention is to use the hash of the multiset to create the compressed label.\nWhen comparing the partition of the nodes by compressed label from one iteration to the next to see whether to proceed to another iteration, it is sufficient to compare which nodes are in each partition. If the partitions change, we proceed to the next iteration. If no partition changes, the algorithm can terminate early. When comparing the partitions of the nodes across graphs to see if graphs are isomorphic, we use the canonical form as described above in the algorithm.\nFinding the Correspondance Between Isomorphic Graphs The core idea of the Weisfeiler-Lehman isomorphism test is to find for each node in each graph a signature based on the neighborhood around the node. These signatures can then be used to find the correspondance between nodes in the two graphs, which can be used to check for isomorphism.\nIn the algorithm descibed above, the \u0026ldquo;compressed labels\u0026rdquo; serve as the signatures. Since multiple nodes may have the same compressed label, there are multiple possible correspondances suggested by a Weisfeiler-Lehman labeling. The Weisfeiler-Lehman isomorphism test itself does not provide a way of narrowing down the possible correspondances further.\nThe Disappearance of Boris Weisfeiler Boris Weisfeiler \u0026ndash; one of the two mathematicians responsible for the Weisfeiler-Lehman isomorphism test \u0026ndash; was a professor at Penn State University until he disappeared mysteriously in Chile in 1985. His disappearance in the 80s is unsettling, and I would encourage you to visit boris.weisfeiler.com to learn more about the search for Weisfeiler and the ongoing (2018) judicial proceedings surrounding his disappearance.\nSteven List produced an award winning short film called The Colony based on the disappearance of Boris Weisfeiler, available on Vimeo here.\nAfter a brief internet search, I have been unable to find any information about Weisfeiler\u0026rsquo;s colleague and coauthor A. Lehman, not even a first name. (Update Aug. 2020: A reader pointed me to this recent story about Andrey Leman. Thank you!)\nNP-Intermediate Problems As mentioned in the introduction, it is not known whether the graph isomorphism problem is in $\\text{P}$ or $\\text{NP-complete}$. In fact, it is not even known whether graph isomorphism falls in either of these categories, or whether this problem is $\\text{NP-intermediate}$. The problem of factoring integers is another problem like this, where it is unknown whether the problem is in $\\text{P}$, $\\text{NP-complete}$, or is $\\text{NP-intermediate}$. Bear in mind that $\\text{NP-intermediate}$ problems can only exist if $\\text{P} \\ne \\text{NP}$. So if anyone were to show conclusively that factoring or graph isomorphism were $\\text{NP-intermediate}$ they would also have shown $\\text{P} \\ne \\text{NP}$ and won the Clay Institute P vs NP Millenium Problem\u0026rsquo;s million dollar prize.\nApplications of Graph Isomorphisms Now that you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with the Weisfeiler-Lehman test for graph isomorphisms, what is the graph isomorphism problem good for?\nThere are applications of the graph isomorphism problem in, for example, computational chemistry and in circuit design.\nIn chemistry, it is common to represent a molecule as a graph, with the atoms in the molecule being the nodes of the graph and the bonds between molecules being the edges. Here, the graph isomorphism problem can be used to determine if two chemical structures are in fact the same structure. This is important for drug discovery, where scientists are working to create molecular structures that will be useful in order to fight diseases.\nA circuit is commonly represented as a graph as well. The components in the circuit form the nodes of the graph, and the connections between components form the edges. The graph isomorphism problem is useful here for determining whether two circuits that are laid out different are in fact identical.\nReferences Weisfeiler and Lehman first proposed this method in their paper A reduction of a graph to a canonical form and an algebra arising during this reduction in 1968. An English translation of this paper, originally published in Russian, is available here.\nMore recently the method is also described succinctly in Weisfeiler-Lehman Graph Kernels (Shervashidze 2011).\nNow go forth and detect graph isomorphisms!\n","date":1557446400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557446400,"objectID":"06ac8bc3dc057b88709f32ee7e138666","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/post/2019-05-10-weisfeiler-lehman-isomorphism-test/","publishdate":"2019-05-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-05-10-weisfeiler-lehman-isomorphism-test/","section":"post","summary":"Explains the Weisfeiler-Lehman Graph Isomorphism Test","tags":[],"title":"The Weisfeiler-Lehman Isomorphism Test","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1540512000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540512000,"objectID":"3b7b100d031b3b150a269a1faa07444a","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/projects/","publishdate":"2018-10-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/","section":"","summary":"An overview of projects","tags":null,"title":"Projects","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["David Bieber"],"categories":null,"content":"Google Apps Script is endlessly useful; in this post you will learn how to write a mail merge with Google Apps Script. It\u0026rsquo;s less than 30 lines of code! You can use this technique to send personalized emails individually to many recipients. In the second part of this post, you will learn how to schedule these emails to send in the future.\nPart 1: Writing a Mail Merge A mail merge is a program that sends an email to many recipients, automatically filling in the contents of the email according to a template. It\u0026rsquo;s like a form letter. Each recipient receives a personalized copy of the email.\nIn this section we use Google Apps Script to create a mail merge that sends personalized \u0026ldquo;Happy Birthday\u0026rdquo; messages to a group of our friends. This will involve writing a template email, creating a spreadsheet, and writing a small amount of JavaScript code. With practice, you can perform tasks like this in well under an hour.\nFirst, we draft the email in Gmail. We\u0026rsquo;ll use angle brackets for the parts of the message we want to replace with data from our spreadsheet.\nSubject: Happiest Birthday! Body: Dear \u0026lt;name\u0026gt;, Happy birthday! I think you, \u0026lt;name\u0026gt;, personally are awesome. You may be getting older, but you're still the coolest person I know. What are you now, \u0026lt;age\u0026gt;? Wow. Party on! David  Next, we create a Google Spreadsheet ( sheets.google.com) with three columns like this:\nName Email Age ... ... ...  (To add yourself to my spreadsheet and actually receive a happy birthday email on your alleged birthday, just fill out this form.)\nInside your spreadsheet, choose Tools \u0026gt; Script Editor. This creates a new Apps Script associated with your spreadsheet.\nNow it\u0026rsquo;s time to write some JavaScript. We\u0026rsquo;re going to write a function to perform the mail merge. We\u0026rsquo;ll call it performMailMerge and it won\u0026rsquo;t have any parameters, e.g.:\nfunction performMailMerge() {}  It will use the built in SpreadsheetApp library to access the spreadsheet, the SpreadsheetDB library to perform basic data lookup operations on the spreadsheet, and the built in GmailApp library to look up drafts and send emails.\nSpreadsheetDB is a small library (a collection of useful functions) that allows us to quickly process rows in a spreadsheet, referencing columns by their header names. Choose one of the two options below for using SpreadsheetDB.\n  To use the library SpreadsheetDB, choose Resources \u0026gt; Libraries \u0026gt; Add a library and enter 193p7IxBukPVkoxwMH8UDcdkYJiNCDWSylMA_htgliEPxjjqixhzKt_2g. This is the ID of the SpreadsheetDB library. Select the latest version from the version dropdown menu. It should say \u0026ldquo;SpreadsheetDB\u0026rdquo; if you\u0026rsquo;ve done it right. This will allow you to use functions from the SpreadsheetDB library in your project.\n  To use SpreadsheetDB from source, create a new file in your project and name it spreadsheet.gs (the name is not important). Copy and paste in the source of SpreadsheetDB from the Gist here. If you choose to copy and paste the source into your project, then you must omit the prefix \u0026ldquo;SpreadsheetDB.\u0026rdquo; from your calls to the SpreadsheetDB functions in the following code. E.g. SpreadsheetDB.getColumnIndexesFromSheet would become just getColumnIndexesFromSheet.\n  Now that you\u0026rsquo;re set up with SpreadsheetDB, I\u0026rsquo;ll start by showing you the full program, then I\u0026rsquo;ll explain what each line does.\nfunction performMailMerge() { var spreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet(); var sheet = spreadsheet.getSheetByName(\u0026quot;Sheet 1\u0026quot;); var indexes = SpreadsheetDB.getColumnIndexesFromSheet(sheet); var subject = \u0026quot;Happiest Birthday!\u0026quot;; var draftMessage = getDraftMessageBySubject(subject); var templateBody = draftMessage.getPlainBody(); SpreadsheetDB.forEachRow(sheet, function(row) { var name = row[indexes[\u0026quot;Name\u0026quot;]]; var email = row[indexes[\u0026quot;Email\u0026quot;]]; var age = row[indexes[\u0026quot;Age\u0026quot;]]; var body = templateBody.replace(/\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;/g, name).replace(/\u0026lt;age\u0026gt;/g, age); GmailApp.sendEmail(email, subject, body); }); } function getDraftMessageBySubject(subject) { var draftMessages = GmailApp.getDraftMessages(); for (var i = 0; i \u0026lt; draftMessages.length; i++) { var draftMessage = draftMessages[i]; if (draftMessage.getSubject() == subject) { return draftMessage; } } }  The documentation for the built in libraries is very good. You can find the documentation for SpreadsheetApp here and for GmailApp here.\nLet’s look at the pieces of this function individually:\nvar spreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet(); var sheet = spreadsheet.getSheetByName(\u0026quot;Sheet 1\u0026quot;);  This gives us a Sheet object that we can use to access and edit the main sheet of our spreadsheet.\nThe function call SpreadsheetDB.getColumnIndexesFromSheet(sheet) gives us back a mapping from column name to index. This is useful for accessing elements of a row by name later on. In our case, the result of getColumnIndexesFromSheet is the following mapping: {Name: 0, Email: 1, Age: 2}. This means that Name is column index 0, Email is column index 1, and Age is column index 2. We’re counting columns starting with zero. Perfect!\nThe call to getDraftMessageBySubject gets a draft from our Gmail drafts that we’ll use later to send the emails to our friends.\nWe use the SpreadsheetDB.forEachRow function to perform an action for each row in the spreadsheet except the headers. We pass a function with no name (an \u0026ldquo;anonymous function\u0026rdquo;) to SpreadsheetDB, and SpreadsheetDB will call that function once per non-header row of our spreadsheet.\nvar name = row[indexes[\u0026quot;Name\u0026quot;]]; var email = row[indexes[\u0026quot;Email\u0026quot;]]; var age = row[indexes[\u0026quot;Age\u0026quot;]];  The input to our anonymous function, row, is an array with the contents of the row currently being processed. From earlier, indexes[\u0026ldquo;Name\u0026rdquo;] is 0, indexes[\u0026ldquo;Email\u0026rdquo;] is 1, and indexes[\u0026ldquo;Age\u0026rdquo;] is 2. We can use this to get the name, email, and age of one of our friends from the spreadsheet.\nvar body = templateBody.replace(/\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;/g, name).replace(/\u0026lt;age\u0026gt;/g, age);  This is where the textual replacement actually happens. \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; is replaced with your friend\u0026rsquo;s name. \u0026lt;age\u0026gt; is replaced with your friend\u0026rsquo;s age. The \u0026lsquo;g\u0026rsquo; indicates that a \u0026ldquo;global\u0026rdquo; replacement should be performed, so every time the string \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; appears it will be replaced by the name of your friend from the spreadsheet. Without the \u0026lsquo;g\u0026rsquo;, only the first occurence of \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; would be replaced.\nGmailApp.sendMail(email, subject, body);  Last, this line sends the email!\nSince this is JavaScript, you can comment out lines by putting // at the start of the line. Everything occuring after // on the line will have no affect.\nI recommend commenting out the GmailApp.sendMail line before running this for the first time to so that you don\u0026rsquo;t accidently email people incorrectly.\nAdd the line Logger.log(\u0026quot;To: \u0026quot; + email); Logger.log(\u0026quot;Subj: \u0026quot; + subject); Logger.log(\u0026quot;Body: \u0026quot; + body); in place of the GmailApp.sendMail line until you\u0026rsquo;re convinced that the correct emails are going to be sent to the correct people. Only once you are sure it\u0026rsquo;s working as intended, uncomment the GmailApp.sendMail line so it actually sends the emails.\nTo run the performMailMerge function, choose performMailMerge from the dropdown and click the run (right-arrow) button. To see your logs (the inputs to the Logger.log function calls), choose \u0026ldquo;View \u0026gt; Logs\u0026rdquo; or press ctrl-Enter or cmd-Enter.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it. When you run performMailMerge, the emails will be sent with the values from the spreadsheet substituted for the \u0026ldquo;\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;\u0026rdquo; placeholders in the draft. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve got the hang of this, let\u0026rsquo;s add a few finishing touches before moving on to scheduling emails to be sent in the future.\nFinishing Touches Finishing touch 1: Adding a \u0026ldquo;Status\u0026rdquo; column to avoid emailing people twice.\nName Email Age Status ... ... ... ...  Let\u0026rsquo;s add some finishing touches. Add to your spreadsheet a new column \u0026ldquo;Status\u0026rdquo;. When an email sends successfully, we\u0026rsquo;ll set the status of the row to \u0026ldquo;Done\u0026rdquo;. If the status of a row is already \u0026ldquo;Done\u0026rdquo;, we\u0026rsquo;ll skip that row. The updated code is shown here:\nfunction performMailMerge() { var spreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet(); var sheet = spreadsheet.getSheetByName(\u0026quot;Sheet 1\u0026quot;); var indexes = SpreadsheetDB.getColumnIndexesFromSheet(sheet); var subject = \u0026quot;Happiest Birthday!\u0026quot;; var draftMessage = getDraftMessageBySubject(subject); var templateBody = draftMessage.getPlainBody(); SpreadsheetDB.forEachRow(sheet, function(row) { var name = row[indexes[\u0026quot;Name\u0026quot;]]; var email = row[indexes[\u0026quot;Email\u0026quot;]]; var age = row[indexes[\u0026quot;Age\u0026quot;]]; var status = row[indexes[\u0026quot;Status\u0026quot;]]; if (status == \u0026quot;Done\u0026quot;) { return; } var body = templateBody.replace(/\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;/g, name).replace(/\u0026lt;age\u0026gt;/g, age); GmailApp.sendEmail(email, subject, body); row[indexes[\u0026quot;Status\u0026quot;]] = \u0026quot;Done\u0026quot;; return row; }); }  In order to make this change, we just check the value of row[indexes[\u0026quot;Status\u0026quot;]], and use a return statement to skip the row if the status is \u0026ldquo;Done\u0026rdquo;. In order to update the row, we modify the row array and return it and SpreadsheetDB takes care of updating the underlying spreadsheet.\nWith this change in place, we can now add new recipients to our spreadsheet even after having run the performMailMerge function, and if we run performMailMerge again we won\u0026rsquo;t email anyone who has already received an email.\nFinishing touch 2: Adding a menu item that triggers our function.\nWhen we created our Apps Script, it was automatically associated with our spreadsheet. If we add a function named onOpen() to our Apps Script, it will automatically get run when the associated spreadsheet is opened. We can add a menu item to our spreadsheet by writing an onOpen function like this one:\nfunction onOpen() { SpreadsheetApp.getUi() .createMenu('Mail Merge') .addItem('Send Emails', 'performMailMerge') .addToUi(); }  Go ahead and refresh your spreadsheet. You should now see a menu called \u0026ldquo;Mail Merge\u0026rdquo; with a menu item \u0026ldquo;Send Emails\u0026rdquo;. Selecting \u0026ldquo;Send Emails\u0026rdquo; will cause your performMailMerge function to be run.\nPart 2: Scheduling Emails for the Future In Part 1 we wrote a mail merge function that emails our friends \u0026ldquo;personalized\u0026rdquo; Happy Birthday messages when we run performMailMerge. But why would we want to say happy birthday to all our friends at once? That\u0026rsquo;s silly, it makes much more sense to send them a happy birthday message on their birthday. In this section, we\u0026rsquo;ll modify our mail merge to send emails only on the birthday of the recipient.\nTo start, let\u0026rsquo;s add a new \u0026ldquo;Birthday\u0026rdquo; column to our spreadsheet.\nName Email Age Birthday Status ... ... ... ... ...  We\u0026rsquo;re going to use the moment.js library for working with dates. Create a new file (File \u0026gt; New \u0026gt; Script File) in your Apps Script project. Call it moment.gs, or anything else, and paste in the contents of the moment.js library. You can copy and paste moment.js from here. Note: Be sure to use the non-minified version of moment.js; if you try using the minified version you will likely have trouble pasting the library into your Apps Script project.\nNow that we have moment.js, we can get the date of our friends birthday like this: moment(row[indexes[\u0026quot;Birthday\u0026quot;]])\nWe can then write the function isTodaysDate like this. This will check that the month and day of the given date are today\u0026rsquo;s month and day, irrespective of what year the given date has.\nfunction isTodaysDate(date) { var now = moment(); return now.isSame(date.year(now.year()), \u0026quot;day\u0026quot;); }  Putting it all together, we have this updated version of performMailMerge that will only send the email if the current date matches the birthday of the recipient.\nfunction isTodaysDate(date) { var now = moment(); return now.isSame(date.year(now.year()), \u0026quot;day\u0026quot;); } function performMailMerge() { var spreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet(); var sheet = spreadsheet.getSheetByName(\u0026quot;Sheet 1\u0026quot;); var indexes = SpreadsheetDB.getColumnIndexesFromSheet(sheet); var subject = \u0026quot;Happiest Birthday!\u0026quot;; var draftMessage = getDraftMessageBySubject(subject); var templateBody = draftMessage.getPlainBody(); SpreadsheetDB.forEachRow(sheet, function(row) { var name = row[indexes[\u0026quot;Name\u0026quot;]]; var email = row[indexes[\u0026quot;Email\u0026quot;]]; var age = row[indexes[\u0026quot;Age\u0026quot;]]; var status = row[indexes[\u0026quot;Status\u0026quot;]]; var birthday = moment(row[indexes[\u0026quot;Birthday\u0026quot;]]); if (status == \u0026quot;Done\u0026quot;) { return; } if (!isTodaysDate(birthday)) { return; } var body = templateBody.replace(/\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;/g, name).replace(/\u0026lt;age\u0026gt;/g, age); GmailApp.sendEmail(email, subject, body); row[indexes[\u0026quot;Status\u0026quot;]] = \u0026quot;Done\u0026quot;; return row; }); } function getDraftMessageBySubject(subject) { var draftMessages = GmailApp.getDraftMessages(); for (var i = 0; i \u0026lt; draftMessages.length; i++) { var draftMessage = draftMessages[i]; if (draftMessage.getSubject() == subject) { return draftMessage; } } }  Now the only step remaining is to make this performMailMerge function run every day. To do this, click the \u0026ldquo;Triggers\u0026rdquo; button in the toolbar (the clock icon). Create a new time-based trigger, and set it up so that it runs Daily (you get to choose when each day it will run). Configure it to run the performMailMerge each day at a time of your choice.\nViola!\nYou now have a mail merge that\u0026rsquo;s running daily automatically, sending your friends Happy Birthday messages on their birthdays. Aren\u0026rsquo;t you a good friend?\nWhile sending birthday emails automatically is somewhat impersonal, the techniques used here are broadly applicable. With Apps Script, you can send yourself reminders, monitor your Calendar events, track your finances, and more. It\u0026rsquo;s a super useful and super friendly set of APIs, and this automated birthday emailer just scratches the surface of what Apps Script makes possible.\nWrap up You\u0026rsquo;ve now learned how to program a mail merge function that uses a spreadsheet as input. You can use a template to send multiple recipients personalized emails. You can schedule these emails to send in the future.\nYou now have a great power, and with it comes great responsibility. Don\u0026rsquo;t use this for spam. Be kind and courteous to your fellow citizens of the internet. If you find this useful, do let me know what you use it for (I\u0026rsquo;m @Bieber on Twitter). I\u0026rsquo;m using Google Apps Script for a variety of things these days and I am always interested to hear how others are using the same tools.\n","date":1540080000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540080000,"objectID":"9880a12f6665d1a8498b79335a250447","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/post/2018-10-21-apps-script-mail-merge/","publishdate":"2018-10-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2018-10-21-apps-script-mail-merge/","section":"post","summary":"Use Google Apps Script to write a mail merge and schedule emails to send in the future.","tags":["Google Apps Script","Automation"],"title":"Writing a Mail Merge in Google Apps Script","type":"post"},{"authors":["David Bieber"],"categories":null,"content":"Originally posted on the Google Open Source Blog\nToday we are pleased to announce the open-sourcing of Python Fire. Python Fire generates command line interfaces (CLIs) from any Python code. Simply call the Fire function in any Python program to automatically turn that program into a CLI. The library is available from pypi via pip install fire, and the source is available on GitHub.\nPython Fire will automatically turn your code into a CLI without you needing to do any additional work. You don’t have to define arguments, set up help information, or write a main function that defines how your code is run. Instead, you simply call the Fire function from your main module, and Python Fire takes care of the rest. It uses inspection to turn whatever Python object you give it – whether it’s a class, an object, a dictionary, a function, or even a whole module – into a command line interface, complete with tab completion and documentation, and the CLI will stay up-to-date even as the code changes.\nTo illustrate this, let’s look at a simple example.\n#!/usr/bin/env python import fire class Example(object): def hello(self, name='world'): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;Says hello to the specified name.\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; return 'Hello {name}!'.format(name=name) def main(): fire.Fire(Example) if __name__ == '__main__': main()  When the Fire function is run, our command will be executed. Just by calling Fire, we can now use the Example class as if it were a command line utility.\n$ ./example.py hello Hello world! $ ./example.py hello David Hello David! $ ./example.py hello --name=Google Hello Google!  Of course, you can continue to use this module like an ordinary Python library, enabling you to use the exact same code both from Bash and Python. If you’re writing a Python library, then you no longer need to update your main method or client when experimenting with it; instead you can simply run the piece of your library that you’re experimenting with from the command line. Even as the library changes, the command line tool stays up to date.\nAt Google, engineers use Python Fire to generate command line tools from Python libraries. We have an image manipulation tool built by using Fire with the Python Imaging Library, PIL. In Google Brain, we use an experiment management tool built with Fire, allowing us to manage experiments equally well from Python or from Bash.\nEvery Fire CLI comes with an interactive mode. Run the CLI with the --interactive flag to launch an IPython REPL with the result of your command, as well as other useful variables already defined and ready to use. Be sure to check out Python Fire’s documentation for more on this and the other useful features Fire provides.\nBetween Python Fire’s simplicity, generality, and power, we hope you find it a useful library for your own projects.\n","date":1488758400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488758400,"objectID":"17e0a621b829262a0a17d56ec505dbdd","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/post/2017-03-06-introducing-python-fire/","publishdate":"2017-03-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2017-03-06-introducing-python-fire/","section":"post","summary":"Python Fire automatically generates command line interfaces from any Python objects.","tags":["Python Fire"],"title":"Introducing Python Fire","type":"post"},{"authors":["David Bieber"],"categories":null,"content":"This is my translation of P.D.

Now I\u0026rsquo;m able to drive a headless version of Firefox with Selenium using Python. This lets me do things like have my Scrabble Bot play Words with Friends autonomously on Facebook.\nWhat am I going to show you how to do?\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to explain how you can install Firefox and Selenium on a virtual machine in the cloud. I\u0026rsquo;m going to show this using a Debian instance on Google Compute Engine, but you could also do this using a virtual machine from Amazon EC2.\nBefore continuing you should create a virtual machine running Debian on Google Compute Engine (GCE). You can learn how to spin up a VM here. Make sure that you can SSH into your machine.\nInstalling Firefox\nWe\u0026rsquo;re actually going to install Iceweasel. To the best of my knowledge, the only difference between Iceweasel and Firefox is the branding. To do this, we\u0026rsquo;re going to:\n Update the sources list that apt-get uses to find packages. Edit the file /etc/apt/sources.list and add the line deb http://mozilla.debian.net/ wheezy-backports iceweasel-release. Update apt-get by running the command sudo apt-get update. Install Iceweasel by running the command sudo apt-get install -t wheezy-backports iceweasel.  I figured this out by searching for \u0026ldquo;iceweasel sources list\u0026rdquo;, which brought me to http://mozilla.debian.net/. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking to install a different version of Iceweasel/Firefox or have a different version of Debian, check there.\nRunning Firefox\nWe can now run the browser we installed with the command firefox or iceweasel, but it will shut down because there is no display. To run the browser without a display (that is, to run it \u0026ldquo;headlessly\u0026rdquo;), we\u0026rsquo;re going to:\n Install the display server Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) with the command sudo apt-get install xvfb. Start the display server with the command sudo Xvfb :10. Here, :10 is the server number we chose for the virtual display we\u0026rsquo;re creating. Now run export DISPLAY=:10.  You should now be able to run firefox or iceweasel successfully.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to see what\u0026rsquo;s on your virtual display, Wikipedia provides an example of how to take a screenshot of your virtual display.\nInstalling Selenium\nWe can now run a headless version of Firefox. Since there\u0026rsquo;s no user interface to click around in, the next logical step is to learn how to drive the browser. For this, we\u0026rsquo;re going to set up Selenium in Python. When dealing with packages in Python, I recommend using pip inside a virtualenv with virtualenvwrapper. There are instructions for setting up these packages below.\nOnce you have virtualenvwrapper installed and you\u0026rsquo;re safely working in a virtual environment, just issue the command pip install selenium to install selenium. If you\u0026rsquo;re not in a virtualenv, you may need to issue the command with sudo.\nTry running this Python script to see if it\u0026rsquo;s all working. It should take you to Google Images, search for cute kittens, and then save a screenshot to the file \u0026lsquo;adorable.png\u0026rsquo;.\n Installing virtualenvwrapper\nAs promised above, here is a section about virtualenvwrapper.\nManaging Python packages effectively is difficult, and I can\u0026rsquo;t do the topic justice here. I recommend using virtualenvwrapper to help, and you can read more about how to do this here. For completeness, I\u0026rsquo;ll briefly run through the steps of getting set up with pip, virtualenv, and virtualenvwrapper.\npip is Python\u0026rsquo;s package manager. Once you have pip set up, you can run pip install package-name to install the package called package-name.\nTo set up pip, run the following commands:\n curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py \u0026gt; get-pip.py sudo python get-pip.py  virtualenv is a tool that let\u0026rsquo;s you have different versions of Python and Python packages for different projects that you work on. Combined with virtualenvwrapper, it will help you avoid headaches of keeping track of where your various Python versions live and where they can find their packages on your machine.\nTo install virtualenv, run the command sudo pip install virtualenv.\nTo install virtualenvwrapper, run the command sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper.\nAdd the following three lines to your .bashrc or another startup script:\nexport WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs\nexport PROJECT_HOME=$HOME/Devel\nsource /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh\nYou\u0026rsquo;re now ready to go. Learn more about how to use virtualenvwrapper effectively here.\nLast thoughts\nI hope you find this helpful. You can now install Firefox on Google Compute Engine, run it using a virtual display, and drive it using Selenium with Python. If something isn\u0026rsquo;t working, or if something is working really well and has you super excited, I\u0026rsquo;m happy to talk it through with you.

And they\u0026rsquo;re wonderful. One of my favorite topics, really. People come to these things and they just code all night. Great experience. Tons of fun. Fruit. PacMan. Yadda, yadda, yadda.\nI tell people this all the time, and a pretty common response is \u0026ldquo;so, it\u0026rsquo;s like a hackathon?\u0026rdquo;\nSo I think for a bit. There\u0026rsquo;s coding. There\u0026rsquo;s minimal sleeping. There are tech talks. There are pizzas, snacks, and refreshments. Fruit is hard to come by at a hackathon, but it can be there too. So I concede, \u0026ldquo;yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s a bit like a hackathon.\u0026rdquo;\nBut I know we\u0026rsquo;re wrong. Code@Night doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel like a hackathon at all.\nHere, I made you an analogy. It\u0026rsquo;s not a good one, but you can read it anyway. \u0026ldquo;A hackathon is to a Code@Night as a track race is to a stroll through a park.\u0026rdquo;\nOr for you symbolically minded folks\u0026hellip;\nHackathon : Code@Night :: Track race : Evening stroll How can they feel so different when the only core difference is that we\u0026rsquo;ve removed the competitive aspect?\nWell, in some ways Code@Night is a lot like a hackathon, but in others it\u0026rsquo;s not at all. It\u0026rsquo;s a hackathon minus the competition, plus the assortment of non-hackathon things that happen at Code@Nights. e.g. Pacman, the occasional contest, the tight-knit community, lots of fruit, a tech talk smack in the middle. Also, Code@Night runs for 12 hours in the worst case (if people stay for breakfast, we\u0026rsquo;ll feed them), but more realistically only goes from 9 pm to 3-4 am. A hackathon usually lasts 24 hours or more.\nIt sounds like these are small differences from a hackathon, but it\u0026rsquo;s really a completely different atmosphere. There\u0026rsquo;s no start and end time for your project. You can work on the same thing Code@Night to Code@Night if you want. And people don\u0026rsquo;t cluster into teams the way they do at hackathons. You also end up getting large group discussions going, which you rarely get at hackathons because people are rushed to work on their 24 hour product. No one\u0026rsquo;s worrying about prizes or judges. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to demo anything to feel accomplished (but we love demos! they\u0026rsquo;re sure encouraged!) You can build what you want to build, not the thing you think will win over an audience.\nCode@Night isn\u0026rsquo;t about starting. It isn\u0026rsquo;t about finishing. It\u0026rsquo;s about doing. It\u0026rsquo;s about learning. It\u0026rsquo;s about being a part of a community. By removing the artificial competitive aspects and time constraints that hackathons impose on coding, we\u0026rsquo;re left with a really rewarding experience. People step back from their coding in ways they don\u0026rsquo;t at hackathons. They teach about Python, about Hadoop. They sit in boxes ( or put boxes on their heads). They share their projects. They debate bacterial growth characteristics on the surface of crisp orange-colored, peanut butter-flavored flakiness coated in compound chocolate. They talk about technology. And sometimes they write poetry.\nSo, the next time someone asks if a Code@Night is like a hackathon, I\u0026rsquo;ll be ready with my \u0026ldquo;kinda, but not really, actually no\u0026rdquo; answer.

The last time I did an education-centric online Q+A was more than three years earlier. Let\u0026rsquo;s take a look.\nOriginally posted at mathcounts.org in March 2010.\nHow long have you been a MATHCOUNTS coach?\nThis is my second year coaching the Van Antwerp MATHCOUNTS team.\nWhat is your favorite part about being a MATHCOUNTS coach?\nIt\u0026rsquo;s great to see my students having a good time with math. I love seeing their expressions when an idea becomes clear to them (an Aha! moment, as Martin Gardner would have it) or when they solve a challenging problem. I also like seeing their reactions to the problems I write. They seem to enjoy when I put their names into our practice problems. On some occasions, I\u0026rsquo;ll have one idea in mind when I write a problem, but I\u0026rsquo;ll make a typo that makes the question quite absurd. That\u0026rsquo;s always fun to laugh about.\nHow do you prepare your students for MATHCOUNTS competitions?\nLeading up to the Chapter Competition we met once a week after school. These meetings lasted 90 minutes, with a snack break (often called \u0026ldquo;Scoff Time!\u0026rdquo; in excited voices by the students) in the middle. After the team qualified for the State Competition we added a second shorter (45 minute) practice day to the week. On some days we practice with old MATHCOUNTS rounds. Other times we\u0026rsquo;ve played mathematical games such as variations of Greedy Pig and mathified versions of Jeopardy, Tic-Tac-Toe and Hangman. We\u0026rsquo;ve also experimented with a variety of practice formats including relays, topic-specific stations, and something akin to HMMT\u0026rsquo;s Guts Round.\nBefore the Chapter Competition we also hosted a MATHCOUNTS scrimmage at Union College for six local MATHCOUNTS teams, so that the students got a chance to practice in a competition setting before the official contest date. At the scrimmage we also ran an unofficial Countdown Round for all the students interested in participating, which I had a lot of fun emceeing, and I think the students enjoyed as well.\nWhat interesting techniques have you used in the classroom or after school with your students to get them excited about math?\nWhen our final practice before the Chapter Competition was cancelled due to snow, I put together a set of problems for the team to solve before the competition. Each member of the team received one question by email. What was interesting about these problems was that each one depended on the answer to another. This encouraged the team members to work together in the days before the competition to find a set of solutions that satisfied all of the problems simultaneously.\nAnother technique is to encourage the students to share their methods of solving MATHCOUNTS problems with the rest of the team. By sharing their ideas, they frequently spot errors in their own work. Teaching is also a great way to become better versed in the material (that\u0026rsquo;s one of the reasons I do this!), so its a great learning tool for everyone in the room. Often it is easier for someone on the team to explain a difficult concept to another student than for a coach to do this because the students have a better perspective on what parts of the idea are challenging or confusing. It helps a bit that I\u0026rsquo;m only a few years older than my team!\nWhy do you think math is so important for middle school students?\nTo start, it can be fun. The problem solving skills that stem from practicing math are useful in all areas of life. Activities like MATHCOUNTS also help you to think faster and be more creative. And to fully appreciate the world around you or the daily news, it\u0026rsquo;s really important to be comfortable around numbers.\nSpeaking as a high school student, I can also tell you that having a solid foundation in mathematics can be a big stress reducer in school, so it\u0026rsquo;s great to get interested in math early!\nDo you have any advice for Mathletes® hoping to advance in the Competition series?\nPractice, ask questions, and develop a good sleep habit.\nAttending MATHCOUNTS practices is a great place to start, but there are so many ways to go beyond that in becoming a better problem solver. If you\u0026rsquo;re clever with a search engine, you\u0026rsquo;ll find there are tons of resources available including problems on the MATHCOUNTS website, these MATHCOUNTS drills, Mr. Diaz\u0026rsquo;s MATHCOUNTS Bible, and Coach Monks’s MATHCOUNTS Playbook. Get together with members of your team to practice outside of school. Use problems you find online or, better yet, write your own, and don\u0026rsquo;t forget to ask your parents to provide you with a snack.\nIf ever there are problems you don\u0026rsquo;t understand (and this should happen very often), ask about them. At practice it can be difficult to get to all of them because there is so much to do in so little time, but don\u0026rsquo;t limit your questions to your practices. Talk to or email your coach or teachers or siblings or parents or friends or friends' parents. Anyone might have the knowledge or insight to answer/explore your questions.\nWhat advice would you give to new coaches just starting a MATHCOUNTS program?\nHave fun with it, and your students will have fun too (at least in principle, anyhow). Chances are your students will know things and ask things you don\u0026rsquo;t know or can\u0026rsquo;t answer, and that\u0026rsquo;s good. Being a coach is an opportunity to learn as well as to teach.\nThe most important advice I can leave you with (keep in mind I have more experience as a student than as a coach) to get your MATHCOUNTS team off the ground, though, is to provide snacks. I recommend grapes, as they\u0026rsquo;re healthy, tasty, easy to distribute, and avoid the majority of allergy problems.\n","date":1376611200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1376611200,"objectID":"9e4eefd2333c0f5a9af34bcdba246d23","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/post/2013-08-16-mathcounts-coach-q-and-a/","publishdate":"2013-08-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2013-08-16-mathcounts-coach-q-and-a/","section":"post","summary":"Last week I did a Q+A for the Life at KA blog.

Are you related to Justin Bieber?\nIt\u0026rsquo;s funny you should ask that. People tell me all the time \u0026ldquo;sorry about your last name\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I hope you\u0026rsquo;re not related to that singer\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;can you get me free tickets to the Bieber concert?\u0026rdquo; And because of that, I\u0026rsquo;ve started feeling a real connection to the guy. I root for his success. I feel down when people trash his music. I think we could become genuinely good friends if we weren\u0026rsquo;t both vying for the top spot on Google for the search term \u0026ldquo;Bieber.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd no, I don\u0026rsquo;t listen to his music (much).\nSo, Bieber, how did you come to work at Khan Academy?\nSounds like life story time.\nI had some pretty incredible teachers growing up. Lots of them. And not just the grown-up kind \u0026ndash; the peer kind too. Throughout middle and high school I was involved in this fantastic math community, the Albany Area Math Circle. We practiced loads of competition math, and most of what I learned, I learned from other students. Some a few years older than me, some a few years younger.\nHere I got involved in coaching MathCounts, and I quickly realized that I love teaching. I ran a math camp for middle school students one summer and I had a blast doing it. Whatever I was going to do with my life, it was going to involve teaching in some capacity.\nFast forward a couple years, and I\u0026rsquo;m sitting in a dining hall in some castle in Princeton. I\u0026rsquo;m talking with some friends about startup ideas \u0026ndash; I have a lot of friends interested in entrepreneurship \u0026ndash; and I have a brilliant idea for a company. (I love getting lost in the excitement of a good idea.) \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll take classes, and we\u0026rsquo;ll put them online. Just Princeton classes to start \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;ll be like MIT\u0026rsquo;s OpenCourseWare \u0026ndash; but we\u0026rsquo;ll make it scalable. And any student with their professor\u0026rsquo;s permission will be able to really easily get their classes' lectures online.\u0026rdquo; Sounds a bit like Coursera. Or YouTube. From there on out, I gave a lot of thought to teaching at scale.\nWhich brings us to Khan Academy. I\u0026rsquo;m interested in programming and technology and education, and I\u0026rsquo;m all for making the world a better place. What better way than the KA way to leverage my interests to facilitate teaching at scale?\nWait\u0026hellip; You said you were sitting in a castle?\nYeah, half the buildings on campus are castles. But that\u0026rsquo;s not the best thing about Princeton. The best thing about Princeton is Code@Night (though I\u0026rsquo;m biased \u0026ndash; I organize them). Every two to three weeks there\u0026rsquo;s a Code@Night where people gather in this beautiful non-castle building called Sherrerd to code at night. Usually a student or professor or an engineer from a sponsor company will give a tech talk or a demo. People will code all night, they\u0026rsquo;ll play PacMan and eat pizza. Sometimes they\u0026rsquo;ll write poetry. It\u0026rsquo;s really an incredible experience. There are even whiteboards all along the walls making it an ideal environment for puzzles.\nDo you have a puzzle you could share with us?\nSure. Here\u0026rsquo;s one that was going around the KA office recently.\nThere are one hundred prisoners in a prison, and the warden is a bit too much of a puzzle enthusiast. She finds an empty jail cell, and into it puts one hundred boxes. Under each box she puts the name of one of the prisoners, so every prisoner\u0026rsquo;s name appears under precisely one box.\nThen she tells the prisoners this:\nEach one of you will be led individually into the jail cell with one hundred boxes. Under one of these boxes is your name. You will each be allowed to look under 50 boxes, but if even one of you doesn\u0026rsquo;t find your own name, all one hundred of you will be locked away forever. That said, if all of you find your own name then you will be freed immediately.\nThe prisoners are terrified, but also excited. They love puzzles too. Help them form a strategy to maximize the chance that they\u0026rsquo;ll be granted their freedom.\nSome caveats: Once the prisoners start going into the cell with the boxes, no communication between the prisoners is allowed. And the prisoners cannot make any modifications to the room with the boxes either \u0026ndash; no leaving boxes turned over, no writing on the walls, and no taking boxes out of the room or moving them, even the one with your name under it.\nGood luck.\nSounds tough. What\u0026rsquo;s the answer?\nPshhh, don\u0026rsquo;t give up yet. It\u0026rsquo;s a really good puzzle. Who\u0026rsquo;s asking these questions, anyway?\nThat\u0026rsquo;d be me. David Bieber.\nSo what you\u0026rsquo;re telling me is that I\u0026rsquo;m involved in a virtual interview\u0026hellip; with myself?\nYeah.\nAnd to think I thought the Turing test was hard\u0026hellip; why are you writing all this anyway?\nWell, it\u0026rsquo;s good to take a break from coding every now and again. Plus, I really like having people read the things I write \u0026ndash; I found this out after starting my blog a year ago ( take a look!) \u0026ndash; it makes the writing process a lot more fun. It also gives you all a better feel for life at Khan Academy, and that transparency is really valuable. We’re real people who make KA run! Seeing all the awesome stuff on this blog is part of why I came to work here. But most of all, the writing really is fun! Especially the Bieber bit \u0026ndash; I had a good time writing that.

It\u0026rsquo;s also, most of the time, the most fun way to learn. And as an added bonus, the person you\u0026rsquo;re teaching learns too.\nI strongly believe that you, as someone who has found themselves reading strange blogs on the internet, have a lot to offer the world in the way of teaching. So I want you to teach at scale. Yes, I\u0026rsquo;m looking at you Mom and Dad, former Facebook and Twitter interns, my fellow interns here at Khan Academy. I\u0026rsquo;m looking at you, my Princeton and Nisky friends, and my former MathCounts students. Yes, even you, HackerNews readers and Google searchers and friends of friends. I want you to give teaching at scale a try.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s hard. Don\u0026rsquo;t mislead yourself into thinking this is an easy task that I\u0026rsquo;ve laid out for you. It takes courage and confidence. When you teach at scale, you make yourself vulnerable. You have to be ready for people to catch your mistakes and challenge your teachings. People will out-think you, and you should be ready to embrace that.\nWhat, then, should you teach? I offer two suggestions. 1) Teach what you want to learn, and 2) teach what you know best. Sometimes the best teachers are not those with 10 years of teaching experience in a subject, but rather the people who remember what it\u0026rsquo;s like not to know. Teach something while the Aha! moment that helped you understand it is still fresh in your mind. The second suggestion, teach what you know best, sounds obvious, but the reason behind it has some subtlety. Don\u0026rsquo;t teach what you know best because you\u0026rsquo;ll probably avoid mistakes on that topic \u0026ndash; do it because it\u0026rsquo;s something you can speak passionately about. If your teachings get a student genuinely excited about a topic, that is worth so much more than having them quickly master it.\nSo how should you get started? The simplest way is to blog. You can set up a blog and be started writing in minutes by signing up at tumblr.com. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve written something educational, share it with your friends and with online communities. Related to technology? Post it on HackerNews.\nDIY method two of teaching at scale is to make YouTube videos. I gave this a try making videos teaching Item Response Theory and Bloom Filters. Here\u0026rsquo;s my setup.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a piece of cardboard with a hole cut out of it for a camera to look through, mounted above some paper. I used my iPhone as the camera.\nHere are the resulting Bloom Filter videos, mistakes and stuttering and blurriness and all. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty embarrassed by them, and I\u0026rsquo;m hoping future videos I produce will come out better.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTFg4cPjhl-2nrkIR1z_MSTcxNeyPk4PO\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to continue to make videos as I learn awesome things over the years, and I hope you do the same.\nHow you teach at scale is up to you. Blog. Make videos. Post code. Start a math circle.\nBe creative. The most effective teachers-at-scale are not always those who leverage technology to reach a wide audience. They are those who teach passionately, and in doing so infect others with a love for learning and teaching.\n","date":1375837200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1375837200,"objectID":"d6170353fb14da08dd778dc58905fc86","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/post/2013-08-07-teach-at-scale/","publishdate":"2013-08-07T01:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2013-08-07-teach-at-scale/","section":"post","summary":"The best way to learn is to teach.

Scroll down and skip to the code. That\u0026rsquo;s the good part anyway.\nOne of the beauties of programming is the elimination of redundant aspects of life that you find yourself doing over and over again. When you find yourself calling home every weekend, logging hours at your job daily, or getting your hair cut every month, it\u0026rsquo;s time to learn to program. Write a short script to do these repetitive behaviors for you. Just kidding. Don\u0026rsquo;t.\nThese are joke examples \u0026ndash; I strongly advise against automating discussions with your mother \u0026ndash; but they aren\u0026rsquo;t so farfetched. Automating processes - shopping, shipping, server maintenance - save countless hours and dollars. Here, we\u0026rsquo;ll do a thought experiment: imagine a team of people running Amazon.com without automation. As a crude estimate, let\u0026rsquo;s suppose they sell a mere billion books each year. Let\u0026rsquo;s imagine they only handle 1% of all Internet traffic. And let\u0026rsquo;s pretend they only store 1 trillion objects in their S3 storage system. Then with their team of about ninety thousand, each Amazon employee would have to be selling and shipping 30 books a day on top of processing and transmitting over 100 gigabytes of Internet traffic daily, all while handling requests for a hundred thousand S3 objects that they\u0026rsquo;ve had to memorize. Maybe Jeff Bezos could pull it off. But you\u0026rsquo;re not Jeff Bezos, so I\u0026rsquo;d say it\u0026rsquo;s worth your time to learn to automate.\nEven education is being automated these days. Will the next century\u0026rsquo;s robotic overloads prove to be better professors than the ones we grew up with? To which you may reply: \u0026ldquo;Oh gee whiz! I sure hope we get better robotic overloads in the future! The ones I grew up with were just miserable professors.\u0026rdquo; But that\u0026rsquo;s not what I meant. I\u0026rsquo;m asking whether Khan Academies and Duolingos will replace our real life Ms. Frizzles and Mrs. Gorfs. A brief excursion with Duolingo makes me suspect it will be a major part of all future language educations. This seems counterintuitive. Languages are inherently about communication. The best way to learn a language should necessarily involve communicating (and the very best way will probably forever remain immersion, but often that\u0026rsquo;s not an option). Conversation and human interaction are so fundamental to language learning that it seems almost absurd that a computer could be a good language teacher, at least until we have strong AI. But the computer manages to do one thing extraordinarily well that isn\u0026rsquo;t scalable in a traditional classroom; the computer focuses entirely on me. So, yes, it lacks creativity and the personal touch of a great teacher. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t tell funny stories or crack foreign language jokes. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t show cute movies and it can\u0026rsquo;t relate to me at all. Yet despite all these shortcomings, it\u0026rsquo;s remarkably good at helping me learn the basics of a foreign language, because it can focus on me, going at my pace and not having to devote its efforts to maintaining the attention of 30 other students.\nAutomation has clearly been taking over everywhere for years. You have to join it. It\u0026rsquo;s a real life superpower. So let\u0026rsquo;s learn to automate something basic. We\u0026rsquo;ll go with software: a Python script to send emails.\nI present: the code. You can run it as is. Save it as a file and run it with Python, and it should just work out of the box. Go ahead, try it.\n Awesome. You just sent me an email. What good is this code? Tweak it a bit and you can use it for personal alerts \u0026ndash; systematically check when you\u0026rsquo;re low on milk and email yourself a reminder \u0026ndash; have your computer email you daily with upcoming birthdays; you can even have it buy the gifts. You can email yourself automatically when a course opens up on your registrar\u0026rsquo;s website. We\u0026rsquo;ll talk about auto-enrolling another time. Or you can set up a script to send different versions of emails to different people, like those spam emails that pretend to be personal by including your first name.\nWith great power comes great responsibility. Don\u0026rsquo;t send spam.\nWith a new Python library in your toolbox, I hope you save yourself thousands of hours. Until next time, try to stay dry.\nDiscuss on Hacker News.\n","date":1363132800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1363132800,"objectID":"deebaab7376ddb19227034b13f786445","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/post/2013-03-13-automate-your-life-sending-emails/","publishdate":"2013-03-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2013-03-13-automate-your-life-sending-emails/","section":"post","summary":"Use Python to send emails programmatically.","tags":["Automation"],"title":"Automate Your Life: Sending Emails","type":"post"},{"authors":["David Bieber"],"categories":null,"content":"Every pawn is an inverted Lorenz attractor.

It gets more complex over time, but nothing insurmountable. In the beginning, your path is pretty much laid out. You have some control over what directions you go, and these are important decisions. They\u0026rsquo;ll shape your future. They\u0026rsquo;ll change what opportunities you have down the road. But as important as they are, there are relatively few wrong decisions. Sure, you can screw up at any point, including early on. And sometimes the damage is irreparable. As my dad always says, \u0026ldquo;avoid the big mistakes.\u0026rdquo; Aim high, and lay a foundation for yourself to grow. Act with a focus on making your situation the best it can be, always with an eye toward the future. It\u0026rsquo;s the most important thing you can focus on with so much still ahead of you, with so much still unseen.\nLife is all about people. It\u0026rsquo;s about interactions. It\u0026rsquo;s important to realize this, that what you decide to make of a situation has a wide impact, bigger than yourself. When you change the world, you change it for everyone. And when you think to yourself, \u0026ldquo;what should I do now?\u0026rdquo; you also have to think about how others will respond. How will things be different down the road? How will things be different just a few minutes from now? The person sitting across from you: she has her own mind, her own motives. Your intentions and hers- sometimes they align nicely, fitting together perfectly and making both of you better off. But often they don\u0026rsquo;t mesh and they get in each other\u0026rsquo;s way. One must always be wary of this.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s interesting that children don\u0026rsquo;t understand this at first. People don\u0026rsquo;t develop a theory of mind until the age of three or four. Until then, they don\u0026rsquo;t grasp that people have different experiences, different thoughts, and different aspirations. Some people with autism spectrum disorders experience a deficit in their theory of mind that lasts beyond childhood, making life supremely difficult. It\u0026rsquo;s very unfortunate. It takes time before children begin grasp the complexities of life, and at first they cannot puzzle out how others think and how others will behave. Over time, one develops a more analytic mind and the puzzles of behavior become simultaneously more understood and more mysterious.\nTake any individual piece of life and you\u0026rsquo;ll find it mostly transparent. It\u0026rsquo;s a beautiful, colorful thing, completely understandable, devoid of mystery and yet full of wonder. With thoughtful reasoning, you can pretty much figure out how it fits into the bigger picture. Yet the bigger picture itself, like a stained glass window, is so full of intricacies that even with a remarkable attention to detail it seems there is always more to explore. There is always, it seems, another possibility to consider.\nWhen the pieces of life stack up against each other, the transparency fades. It becomes hard to distinguish one thing from another. Important decisions are more difficult to make, yet remain even more consequential than any before. Sometimes you may look out and see something that really excites you: a thought so fun and so novel it drives you to action; you get the idea that everything fits together so nicely. But there\u0026rsquo;s always something missing. That one piece of the puzzle that you can\u0026rsquo;t find, and nothing will fill this void. With everything looking so good, like everything was where it was meant to be, the only way to go from here is down. Your choices are no longer clear, and you can\u0026rsquo;t tell one from another. What to do? What to do?\nThere are tough decisions with trade-offs and you simply cannot please everyone. Know what situation you\u0026rsquo;re in, your strengths and your weaknesses. Lay out your possible decisions clearly in front of you. Organize. Evaluate. You mustn\u0026rsquo;t rush into big decisions.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;re in a tough spot, as you surely will be, do not despair. You may be tempted to look back on your past with regret. Hindsight is 20/20. You couldn\u0026rsquo;t have known about that poor decision, that wasted opportunity. It\u0026rsquo;s a sunk expenditure and you must make the best of your current situation. Sometimes you\u0026rsquo;ll feel like you don\u0026rsquo;t fit in, and that\u0026rsquo;s just part of life.\nAs life progresses, you will have more decisions to make with higher impact. You take on more responsibility with your actions and you have more meaningful interactions with other people. Setting goals, and having them mesh with the goals of others is important. My dad and I agreed to each do 180 days of push-ups and sit-ups this year. Whether or not this sort of goal will lead to success in life is questionable, but having an objective like this is useful. Goals must not be unrealistic, and you should be aware that sometimes it may feel like the world is conspiring against you, and perhaps it is. But often it\u0026rsquo;s not, and when things don\u0026rsquo;t go as planned there is no one to blame but yourself. I\u0026rsquo;ve set out to become a better storyteller this year. Stories, to me, have a lot of value, and they certainly make life more interesting.\nIt is often said a goal should be objective and measurable. For a goal such as storytelling, though, that seems absurd. Progress here can only be measured by a good tale.\nLife, we all know, eventually comes to an end. And as it does so, think about what you want to leave behind. Where do you want your possessions to go? You can\u0026rsquo;t take them with you. So be charitable, and get rid of as much as you can afford. As much as the world is ready for. Think of those who will follow you, and ask yourself how will they feel about your end. Did you leave them in a good situation? Perhaps you set them up to finish soon, just as you did.\nThink of everything. It\u0026rsquo;s all about strategy. Life is a game.\nSorry, have I been writing life? I meant Blokus.\n Blokus is a game.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the gist.

Clone the django-appfog-helloworld repository.  Push to AppFog.  The repository is available at https://github.com/dbieber/django-appfog-helloworld.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what comes with this repo.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a Django project that works out of the box (just download it and python manage.py runserver. If you have Django installed, it\u0026rsquo;ll work!). It\u0026rsquo;s already setup to serve static files. It\u0026rsquo;s all ready to use MySQL or sqlite3. It ships with Bootstrap and jQuery. Django\u0026rsquo;s admin app is enabled and ready to go. It has templates for 404 and 500 errors so you can quickly see how to get error handling working. And it has one app, named app_name, that demonstrates the core functionality of Django: models, views, templating, and forms, by collecting email address of early users to your site. It\u0026rsquo;s a rudimentary version of LaunchRock.\nMy hope is that it will work well both as start code and as reference code for how to get Django working quickly.\nThis template is great for quick and dirty websites. It\u0026rsquo;s perfect for a hackathon or for prototyping an idea with friends. And it\u0026rsquo;s a great template for getting started with Django, Bootstrap, and jQuery. But it\u0026rsquo;s not production quality in two key respects, security and scalability. Keep that in mind as you start building. Now, let\u0026rsquo;s dive deeper into getting your Django app running.\nSetting up AppFog Register for an account at AppFog.com.\nCreate a new \u0026ldquo;Django Python\u0026rdquo; app. Host it on AWS. And give it a name. I called mine \u0026ldquo;helloworld-django\u0026rdquo;. Let\u0026rsquo;s say you call yours name_of_app.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll want to set up the af command line utility to make deploying your site easier later. On Mac or Unix this is as simple as gem install af. Windows instructions are simple too, and are available in the \u0026ldquo;Update Source Code\u0026rdquo; tab of your app on AppFog.\n(Optional) Make sure you have a MySQL database service provisioned. To do this, log in to AppFog, choose your app, and choose the \u0026ldquo;Services\u0026rdquo; tab. You can either bind an existing MySQL database service to your app or create a new one. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a MySQL database provisioned, the app we deploy in a moment will use sqlite3 as a fallback and should work just fine.\nCloning this repository git clone https://github.com/dbieber/django-appfog-helloworld.git\nThe web app is already all ready to be pushed to AppFog.\nBefore you go and push this website live, there are a few things you should do, all marked with TODO in the source code you just downloaded. These are the most important:\n Set your SECRET_KEY in settings.py Set up the ADMINS variable in settings.py Set default admin account credentials in views.py Always be aware of whether DEBUG = True or DEBUG = False in settings.py. This changes how errors are handled and you definitely want DEBUG set to false when your site is public.  Now you\u0026rsquo;re ready to go live!\nPushing to AppFog Be sure to either run python manage.py collectstatic or place all your static files your static directory before pushing.\nLog in to AppFog with the command af login. (Find instructions for setting up the command line tool in the \u0026ldquo;Update Source Code\u0026rdquo; tab of your app on AppFog.com.\nFrom inside the django-appfog-helloworld directory (which, by the way, you are free to rename) run af update name_of_app.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it. Your site is live! You\u0026rsquo;re already collecting email address of beta-testers. Huzzah!\nTesting Locally To test locally, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to install Django.\nTo test your app locally, navigate to the django-appfog-helloworld directory containing manage.py:\npython manage.py runserver runs your app locally. View it at localhost:8000. python manage.py syncdb sets up your local database by default in a file called dev.db. python manage.py collectstatic copies all your static files into your static files directory. python manage.py help for more.\nDjango is a Python based web framework with excellent documentation and tutorials.

I’m curious, so feel free to let me know before reading further (Google form).\nPersonally, there are a just a handful of use cases that make up the vast majority of my email usage. Let’s list them.\nOrganizing talks and events for ACM and Splash! Applications for summer internships Read-only-ish mail (Mailing lists announcing talks and events, class related announcements, discussions I minimally partake in, spam, etc.) Talking with friends For about three months now, I’ve been thinking that email is woefully insufficient for managing my communication needs, particularly use cases 1 and 2. When I’m organizing a Code@Night I’ll often have 3 or more email threads related to the event. In one I’ll be discussing logistics with a company sponsor. In another I’ll be coordinating with other ACM officers. In still another I’ll announce the event to groups around campus. Often even more form when people start replying about how awesome it is that there will be fruit at the event or asking how they can contribute to making the world a better place.\nI thought about how I could improve email so that managing all these communications could be better. Better ways of grouping conversations, by person or by event, would be nice. Having an indicator of what still had to be done and who I still needed to contact would be nice. I realized I could do all of this with Gmail already, combining labels and searches in clever ways. But that would be clunky, and so I was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled upon Streak.\nStreak seems to be targeting sales and recruiting folks, and I think that’s the wrong audience for them. Their product was clearly designed with the sales-recruiting person in mind, but I think it’s equally well suited for the hacker, and not just for tracking bugs. To demonstrate this, I’ll write a bit about what the product does and how I’m using it.\nI have two use cases for Streak so far, corresponding to email uses 1 and 2 in the list above. I use Streak for organizing events and for managing my applications for summer internships. I don’t know that either of these are use cases intended by the folks over at Streak. For organizing events (primarily tech talks and Code@Nights), I have a “Pipeline” in Streak called ACM Events. Into a Pipeline go boxes, one box per event. And a box contains all the emails, documents, comments, and other information pertaining to the event. It’s simple to add an email thread to a box, so I’m always able to keep everything relevant to a particular event in one easily accessible place in the Gmail web client. As the event goes from being just an idea to a complete plan to being successfully executed, its box moves through the pipeline. In this way I can quickly get at all events in a particular part of the planning process or event lifecycle, and I have a convenient archive of all past events.\nFor managing my summer internship applications, Streak has also proved useful. I have a box for each company to which I’m applying. And I put all the emails and documents for that company’s application into the appropriate box. On the company’s end, I’m probably being moved through a hiring pipeline in a similar CRM tool, and now the company is moving through my CRM’s pipeline in parallel.\nThe box and pipeline model took me a bit of tinkering with to really grok. It’s a paradigm shift that takes some getting used to. The email primitive is no longer the conversation, but instead is the thing you are trying to accomplish through the conversation. Say I need to reply to a Facebook recruiter about planning a tech talk here at Princeton. Now rather than using Gmail search to look for a particular email thread I vaguely recall having (perhaps by guessing at words that were in the thread or by scrolling through my email to the date I remember the email having been sent), I simply go to the box I created for the event, and all of the relevant emails are right there. This sounds a lot like labels, but has the distinct advantage that boxes are much more light weight than labels. Once you have more than a dozen labels or so, they become clunky and start cluttering up the Gmail navigation bar.\nDon’t just take my word for it. Give Streak a try.","date":1354147200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1354147200,"objectID":"1805fd5655612cd4b02312f9a211a210","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/post/2012-11-29-crms-not-just-for-sales-folk/","publishdate":"2012-11-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2012-11-29-crms-not-just-for-sales-folk/","section":"post","summary":"In this blog post I recommend Streak, a customer relationship management (CRM) tool that lives inside Gmail.\nDiscuss on Hacker News.\nWhat do you use email for?

I flew out of Princeton yesterday with a group of 20 to spend the week visiting technology companies, startups and venture capitalists in Silicon Valley. We\u0026rsquo;re going company to company hearing founder\u0026rsquo;s stories, discussing entrepreneurship, and as we do this I am forced to introspect. What do I want to do with my life? How can I make a difference?\nMy passion is education. I was fortunate enough to have some amazing mentors growing up, and to learn in a lot of diverse ways most people never have a chance to experience. I tried out gifted programs, nerd camps, one-on-one classes, online self paced learning, the works. I got involved in math circles, I took summer classes, I really was blessed to have every educational opportunity one could hope for. This, and the diversity of amazing teachers I\u0026rsquo;ve had has gotten me thinking about how people learn best, and how I learn best. Complementing this interest well, I\u0026rsquo;ve found I really love teaching- particularly math and computer science to younger students. It\u0026rsquo;s always a joy helping someone to tackle the Bessie the Cow problem or the game of Nim for the very first time.\nToday a lot of young companies bring together my interests of education, computer science and technology. Websites like Coursera, edX, and Udacity virtualize the university experience, and Khan Academy joins them in making quality education accessible everywhere. Startups like Lore and Piazza foster discussions around classes, allowing the learning experience to extend more seamlessly beyond the walls of the classroom.\nToday we trekked over to the new office of Khan Academy where our group got to sit down and discuss education with Sal Khan, and then we were off to Piazza\u0026rsquo;s office where we did Q+A with the question-answer site\u0026rsquo;s founder, Pooja Sankar.\nSal Khan is a really inspirational person. His collection of tutorials - which now spans a wide range of topics including mathematics and organic chemistry and art history - It all began with Sal tutoring his cousins over the phone back in 2004. Hearing him tell his founding story - how he went from tutoring one cousin, to many, to posting videos on YouTube and being well received all over the world. how he came to tutor the Gates children through his videos, and how after discussions with venture capitalists in the valley Sal made the choice to incorporate Khan Academy as a non-profit - Hearing this story from Sal Khan really drove home how empowering technology is and how tech is shaping the future of education. One smart man with a gift for explaining things clearly now teaches millions of students, an unprecedented feat since most lecture halls barely seat one hundred.\nWith the resources Khan Academy is producing, the purpose of the classroom is shifting. Lecture time in classes is becoming less and less valuable, and some classes have adopted a flipped classroom model. Students watch the Khan Academy videos at home, and then come to class with an understanding of the material. Students then use the class time to try out problems that would previously have been homework, now in a setting where they can get immediate help from their peers and their teacher. The flipped classroom model has been highly successful so far. One of Khan Academy\u0026rsquo;s ambitions is to, when someone comes to the site to learn about multiplication, be able to first offer an education on addition or any other prerequisites of the subject. Or after learning about one topic, they\u0026rsquo;d love to provide an education on the next logical thing to study. They\u0026rsquo;ve done a fine job of this with their knowledge map of mathematics. Each skill from 1-digit addition to calculus and linear algebra is connected with its prerequisites. Where this problem gets interesting, and where I\u0026rsquo;m excited to see what Khan Academy does in this space, is with more specialized subject matter. It will be interesting to see how this can be presented when the relationships between material stops being [understanding X is required to know Y] and starts being [X is related to Y] or [X is a good tutorial to follow for people who struggled with Y].\nThe data that Khan Academy is receiving about its millions of users puts the organization in a fantastic place for improving education. By the sheer number of users, there will always be groups of students studying the same material. In order to achieve this with a traditional education, students were forced to learn at the same rate as their twenty classmates. The class would drag slower students forward, and hold the brightest back. With Khan Academy students can devour mathematics at whatever rate they please, and there will still be folks online learning the same things as them. Self paced learning isn\u0026rsquo;t new. John Hopkin\u0026rsquo;s has offered it through their CTY programs for a long time, and MIT\u0026rsquo;s OpenCourseWare has provided content for free for years, but the content has never been open, free, and as community based as it can be today. Khan Academy could bring these students, all learning the same material at the same time, together, perhaps even offline. Study groups like this are popping up all over the world out of Coursera classes. People meet up to watch the lectures together or help each other through homework problems. That\u0026rsquo;s a fantastic way to learn.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s so much to be gained from this sort of interaction. And there\u0026rsquo;s so much to be learned from a group of students working on mathematics together, even when they\u0026rsquo;re all at different skill levels. Traditional classrooms cluster students by grade; they\u0026rsquo;re all learning the same content at the same time, and they have been their whole lives following the same sequence through mathematics as each other. With students learning at their own pace on Khan Academy, it will be great to see a classroom with a wide spectrum of mathematical ability. The sort of learning that takes place when a fast-paced student, studying algebra ahead of his class, works with a peer struggling to master long division is rare and really valuable. This is the type of interaction I expect will arise naturally out of making K-12 mathematics a self paced endeavor while maintaining the traditional 5 days a week classroom setting.\nOne other amazing thing that Khan Academy, Coursera, and these other online education websites will be doing is individualizing the teaching experience. I already mentioned how Khan Academy could recommend different tutorials based on your performance or ability or interests. The individualization that can be done can also take place at a finer level. Coursera co-founder Daphne Koller came to Princeton to speak recently and she explained some of the work being done in this area. The data that Coursera is receiving from students is tremendous in quality and volume. With classes of tens of thousands of people, a single numerical answer question will garner hundreds of different answers. There will be clusters in these answers, with thousands of people submitting the same incorrect response. This gives professors insights into the minds of their students they never had before. With this information, we can figure out exactly what sorts of mistakes are common, and how to avoid them. People likely to make a particular type of mistake can be shown content in a way tailored to them. There may be groups of people who tend to share patterns in which mistakes they make, or which types of material they\u0026rsquo;re good at. The scale at which these courses are being offered and at which the feedback is being received will allow for insights into teaching that were never possible before.\nThat said, I think that while online education is young and still in its stage of constant iteration, feedback should be collected much more explicitly. The value of people\u0026rsquo;s behavior on Khan Academy, Coursera, edX, Udacity, etc should not be understated, but these companies could learn so much more about their content and how students and \u0026ldquo;users\u0026rdquo; respond to their content it they merely asked. If Coursera put up two buttons next to their videos, one labeled \u0026ldquo;boring\u0026rdquo; and one labeled \u0026ldquo;interesting\u0026rdquo; (or \u0026ldquo;simple\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;confusing\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;easy\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;hard\u0026rdquo;), or if they placed a feedback box underneath their video lectures, then I think the professors offering the courses would have a much better understanding of their audience. As it is, with both online lectures and live lectures, the professor gets very little feedback. They wonder Are my student\u0026rsquo;s understanding what I\u0026rsquo;m saying? Am I going to fast? Too slow? Is that kid in the orange shirt snoring?. This is one area where over the next year we have to leverage technology better. We need to get this feedback cycle right soon. These are the days that content is being produced at an incredible rate. The Khan Academy videos that go up this year, the Coursera classes being recorded every day - this is content that will last forever, and as we produce more of it, it\u0026rsquo;s so important that we maintain the highest possible standards, and for that feedback is critical.\nWhile quality is important, so too is the opportunity for everyone to become a teacher. More on those thoughts another day. We won\u0026rsquo;t all produce lectures with the quality of Sal Khan or Kevin Wayne. It is primarily at the top that we must ensure the content is the best it can possibly be. Still, feedback from students is so important to anyone teaching in any capacity.\nThis notion, allowing anyone to teach, is so fundamental to the way education has to be. People learn from other people. Lore understands this. Piazza understands this. This is the philosophy that makes Albany Area Math Circle such an incredible group. This is why college campuses thrive and produce innovation. During our visit with Piazza, founder Pooja Sankar spoke about (in addition to teaching us some great lessons in entrepreneurship from the company\u0026rsquo;s founding story) Piazza\u0026rsquo;s mission to take down barriers to learning. Piazza is really succeeding in this. They\u0026rsquo;ve empowered people so that everyone in the class can be the teacher in a way that\u0026rsquo;s never worked in lecture classes before.\nGoing forward, only good can come of these trends toward moving education online. Khan Academy\u0026rsquo;s mission seems inevitable. A world class education is becoming available to anyone, anywhere. The best ways to make this happen are still being discovered, and there\u0026rsquo;s so much to explore in the world of online pedagogy. This is something to be excited about. This is something I want to be a part of.\n","date":1351555200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1351555200,"objectID":"ba02a3051a7f60bda1f85b700b42de16","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/post/2012-10-30-thoughts-on-education/","publishdate":"2012-10-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2012-10-30-thoughts-on-education/","section":"post","summary":"That concludes day one of the TigerTrek.

I’m a big fan of Scrabble. I love math, puzzles, and playing tennis. I spend a lot of my would-be-free time on Coursera. And I’m vice chair of Princeton’s ACM Group.\nACM stands for Association for Computing Machinery, but that’s not important. I think that name is silly.\nOne of ACM’s main functions on campus is “promoting interest in computing and it’s applications.” That’s from the ACM Constitution, and it’s a beautiful goal, a goal helped along by Code@Nights, and a goal that I encourage you to participate in. Let’s start with Code@Nights, then I’ll point out how you can make a difference.\nIn short, a Code@Night is a fun-filled night of coding, powered by enthusiasm, extension cords, pizza and drinks. That’s right! Enthusiasm :D!\nPersonally, I find all nights of coding are fun-filled, but having a Code@Night guarantees it. Here’s how a typical Code@Night goes. Step 1, the ACM Officers (lovely people by the way) pick a date for the Code@Night and we book a room in the best building on Princeton’s campus, Sherrerd Hall. Sometime we’ll pick a theme (like quines or stenography!) as well.\nSherrerd Hall: We send out an email (and in this case a blog post) to the ACM Group at Princeton, and everybody marks the date on their calendar, because nobody likes to miss a Code@Night.\nThen, hours before the Code@Night begins, the ACM Officers (did I mention how wonderful they are?) scramble to get snacks and beverages ready for the Code@Night, and they inevitably end up with a bit too much Red Bull and Mountain Dew, and never enough fresh fruit.\nThe fruit is very important to the success of a Code@Night. Sure, hackers will show up because you advertise pizza and sugary things, but after a long night of coding, fresh fruit will bring a smile to any developer’s face.\nAround 9pm, the hackery folks begin to arrive. They’ll keep on arriving until well after midnight, so we’re sure to keep the pizza coming and the drinks flowing. Sometimes we’ll plan a tech talk or demos to liven up the night. They come, they code, they conquer. They discuss the latest hacker news. They make the latest hacker news. They share their ideas and expertise with one another, and build pretty cool stuff. And when they’re tired, or realize they have to wake up early the next day for that big Dropbox interview, they leave at 1, 2, 3 in the morning, sometimes later.\nOur next Code@Night is this Friday, September 14, and is open to the Princeton Community. Located on the 3rd Floor of Sherrerd.\nMost of you probably aren’t Princeton students, but still want to attend a Code@Night. To you, I say “make one!” Find a room and shoot an email out to your computer sciencey and hacker friends. Order some pizza and be enthusiastic. And don’t forget the fruit. And when the event is a roaring success, let me know @Bieber or by email: dbieber@princeton.edu! Try it, you’ll like it.\nPrinceton students: I hope to see you there.\nFriday Sept 14, 2012, 9pm - whenever, 3rd Floor Sherrerd Hall","date":1347926400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1347926400,"objectID":"781f9bcb813877f7b9c09d7d4eb42e22","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/post/2012-09-18-whats-a-code-at-night/","publishdate":"2012-09-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2012-09-18-whats-a-code-at-night/","section":"post","summary":"Check out this video showing what Code@Nights are all about!\nSince you’re reading my blog, you should know a little bit about myself.

It's my introduction to the world of blogging, the blog post likely only read by my family and a few techie friends. It's the post in which I make an unrealistic commitment to blog frequently, which I later fail to live up to. And it's the post in which I introduce a new form of blogging, Collapsible Blogging. Here's the tl;dr.\nHello World!\nClick any part of this post to see it in condensed form.\nSource is here: https://gist.github.com/3616675 Click stuff to collapse. Click again to expand.\nBefore we get into the details of Collapsible Blogging, let's start with that commitment to blog. Every half-baked blog has it, so here's mine. Once a month. I know my life is sufficiently not boring that something blog-worthy will come along each month. Why, just last Tuesday I ran with Tyson Mao (yeah, the Rubik's Cube guy) and had a near encounter with Top Gear's Richard Hammond (he came by Twitter while I was interning there). This post counts for September. So you'll be hearing from me next at least before Halloween's end. Here's to a happy, healthy, blogging career!\nI'll blog once a month. And I like name dropping.\nSo, how's this whole Collapsible Blogging thing work, why is it awesome, and how can you try it out? Collapsible Blogging works well with my own internet content consumption habits, which I believe I share with many of the other Hacker News obsessed entrepreneurial spirited folks out there on the internet. Possibly you. I choose an interesting Hacker News article, I read a bit, and I quickly lose interest in favor of another well titled article. My goal is really just to consume quickly the highlights of the web. Collapsible Blogging let's me skim faster. But maybe that's a not a good thing. I'm rereading Fahrenheit 451- and there's a passage this reminds me of:\n\u0026ldquo;I sometimes think drivers don\u0026rsquo;t know what grass is, or flowers, because they never see them slowly,\u0026rdquo; and\n\u0026ldquo;Have you seen the two-hundred-foot-long billboards in the country beyond town? Did you know that once billboards were only twenty feet long? But cars started rushing by so quickly they had to stretch the advertising out so it would last.\u0026rdquo; I don\u0026rsquo;t want Collapsible Blogging to be those two-hundred-foot-long billboards.\nUse Collapsible Blogging to make your content easier to skim. So with that in mind, I introduce the second use of Collapsible Blogging. Diving deeper into a topic. If you'd like to learn more about diving deeper into a topic, click this passage. Collapsible Blogging let's people who aren't interested in the topic read quickly, while people like yourselves who want the full blog post can read more in a single click, as you just discovered. One application of this is resumes. On my resume I list that I have experience with Java, Python, etc. An employer may care just about my lovely Python experience, but my resume doesn't go into details about each technical skill and where I've used them. If I build my resume with Collapsible Blogging, I can make it so that with a single click potential employers can learn more about my experience with just the skills that interests them. They can learn what matters to them without me cluttering my resume with every project I've ever worked on. Likewise, say I write a blog post about my experiences at Twitter and Facebook. You might be interested in reading about the technical challenges I faced and the programming concepts I learned, while another reader might be more curious about the pool party I attended at Zuck's house. If I write my post using Collapsible Blogging, you, the reader, can choose to read about the parts of my experience that interest you most, or you can choose to just skim the collapsed form of the post. Some paragraphs don't have collapsed forms. You can only collapse the passages with a left border. There isn't really a shorter way to say that!  If you're interested in using Collapsible Blogging yourself, it's remarkable easy. I include the source as a gist below. Each passage that I want to collapse, I give an id. Then I create an element with the same id but preceded by an underscore. The CSS below hides elements with ids starting with underscores, and the JS below uses JQuery to handle the swapping in and out of elements. If you're blogging with Tumblr, just paste the code into your theme and you're good to go! Anywhere else, it should be as simple as adding the JS and CSS to your page. Try it.
