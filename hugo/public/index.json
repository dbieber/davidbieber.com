I was just a small piece of this epic endeavor. Bianca was the organizer and driving force for a really impressive piece of puzzle craftsmanship.\nThe premise for the escape room is based on the webcomic Girl Genius. Here's what you need to know:\nEscape Castle Heterodyne There's a castle, Castle Heterodyne, which is a living, breathing, talking entity. In our escape room, the Castle is voiced by Mark Velednitsky. The castle's personality is damaged, and you and your team (4 people total) have been sent into the castle to see if you can repair it. The castle, in it's damaged state, doesn't understand that you're here to help. Quite the opposite in fact; it considers you hostile! At your entrance, Castle Heterodyne slams its doors shut behind you. It cuts power to the lights and activates its 30 minute self-destruct countdown.\nCan you repair the castle, thereby bringing it back to its senses? Can you escape your impending doom? You must solve puzzles and make your way through four decorative challenge-filled rooms if you wish to live to see another day.\nThe Engine Room I was responsible for just the first room of the escape room (as well as, I later learned, anything requiring height). This first room was the Engine Room. When you enter the Engine Room, der Castle promptly kills the lights and initiates the castle's self-destruct sequence.\nYour challenge: get the lights up and running again.\nYou do this by first locating a blacklight flashlight on the table in the room. You use this blacklight flashlight to read clues written in invisible ink on colored paper hidden around the room. These clues in turn allow you to figure out which of the nearly 50 switches you need to flip in order to turn all the lights on without overheating any of them.\nThis is what the puzzle looks like partial solved:\nWhile the physical puzzle is no longer operational, you can have a go at the software-only version of the puzzle: Click here to try the puzzle.\nStorage Closet Once you successfully turn the lights back on in the Engine Room, the castle realizes your utility, and presents you with the key to the next room: the Storage Closet. It's too late to turn off the self-destruct sequence though, and so your only way out is forward, through the Storage Closet and the rest of the castle.\nThe Storage Closet is in my opinion the coolest room in the Castle. I will refrain from spoiling it here (for now), and simply tell you that I was very impressed with the work that went into it.\nEscaping the Castle Making your way through the Storage Closet, you must next navigate the Secret Lab, the Pink Torture Chamber (no puzzles here), and lastly the Crypt. Only after solving the puzzles in each of these rooms with the help can you escape der Castle and avoid a ghastly death.\nThe source code for the Engine Room puzzle (both the physical version and the software-only version) is available on GitHub here.\n","date":1509148800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509148800,"objectID":"bd73a111fb3ddd139ca715edcb8d5a9e","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/projects/escape-castle-heterodyne/","publishdate":"2017-10-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/escape-castle-heterodyne/","section":"projects","summary":"We built an escape room!","tags":["Hardware","Just for Fun","Puzzle"],"title":"Escape Castle Heterodyne","type":"projects"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Python Fire is a Python library for automatically creating command line interfaces (CLIs) from absolutely any Python object.\nCheck it out at https://github.com/google/python-fire.\nI originally wrote Python Fire after joining Google Brain in 2016.

It is designed to minimize the mental energy required for use, to avoid disturbing your attempt at sleep as much as possible.\nWhy is it called shh shell? It's a play on \u0026ldquo;ssh\u0026rdquo;, a common unix utility that stands for \u0026ldquo;secure shell\u0026rdquo;. shh (prounced in a whisper, \u0026ldquo;shhh\u0026hellip;\u0026quot;) is a quiet shell that takes minimal mental energy to use, great for use while you're drifting off to sleep.\nWhat can the shh shell do? My primary use of the shh shell is leaving notes for myself. I also use shh to set peaceful YouTube music alarms for myself, and to check the time without needing to open my eyes.\nHere is the full list (as of 2015-11-28) of my uses of shh shell, past and present:\n Leaving notes for myself for the morning Checking the time Playing YouTube videos (I only hear the audio, of course) Google searching and opening webpages Setting alarms (usually in the form of songs on YouTube) Checking my email Sending emails Sending iMessages Scheduling emails or messages to send in the future Making TODOs for myself Setting goals for the future Performing calculations Practicing relative pitch Recording audio memos of myself for later Executing arbitrary shell commands  The current list of shh commands is available here.\nOf course, not all of these have proven to be useful features. The most useful features for me have been the ability to leave notes for myself for the morning, the ability to check the time without opening my eyes, and the ability to set alarms and listen to music via the shell. The audio memo feature has been occasionally useful too.\nAt no point did I find the ability to check my email via the shh shell useful.\nI did temporarily get good at recognizing pitch intervals, but I have not sustained that ability.\nIs this a replacement for shells like Bash, zsh, and Fish? No, this is not meant as a full replacement for Bash, zsh, Fish, etc.\nThat said, it does support arbitrary command execution though, via the shell command. That means typing :shell rm -f important_file will cause important_file to be removed. So, you have to make sure you're not a self-sabotaging hacker in your sleep before you start using shh as your night time shell.\nYou can additionally add arbitrary new commands by editing the file shh_commands.py.\nWhere do you use the shh shell? I use the shh shell by keeping a wireless keyboard in my bed. It is connected to my laptop, which I leave open but with the monitor turned fully off.\nThis means I'm not at risk of damaging my computer by rolling over on it or drooling on it :).\nI leave the volume on my laptop on, so I can hear the shh shell's output, but I never need to open my eyes to use it.\nCan you use it in the shower? Yes, I sometimes also use shh shell from the shower. I have a waterproof wireless keyboard in my shower. I am mildly embarassed by this.\nThe keyboard is connected wirelessly to my laptop running the shh shell in another room. There is no computer in the bathroom. For audio, I have a waterproof shower speaker connected via bluetooth to the laptop in the other room. The speaker sits in the shower next to the keyboard, which both rest on a ledge. There is a 3D-printed shaving cream holder nearby.\nI know, I hear myself too.\nUsing the shh shell When you open the shh shell on your computer, you get a small black window into which you can type large white text. When you're new to the shell, it can be useful to look at this window to see what you're typing. As you become more experienced with the shh shell, you can turn your monitor off and close your eyes, relying only on the auditory feedback the shell provides.\nGetting in Focus When you type, it's important that you're typing in the shell. If you're not in the shell, you might be typing in another application on your computer or you might not be typing in an application at all.\nTo assist with this, the shell will audibly say \u0026ldquo;focused\u0026rdquo; when the shell becomes your selected application, and \u0026ldquo;focus lost\u0026rdquo; when the shell loses focus. If the shh shell is not in focus, or if you're not sure if the shell is in focus, then use \u0026ldquo;cmd-TAB\u0026rdquo; to switch applications until you hear the shell announce \u0026ldquo;focused\u0026rdquo;. Once you hear this sound, you can safely type knowing that the shell is receiving your input.\nLeaving Notes for Yourself The default mode of the shell is to act as a notepad and keylogger. Every letter typed and every key pressed is logged with a timestamp when you are in the shh shell. Don't worry, this data is only saved locally and keys aren't logged when you're in other applications, so it's not going to steal your credentials for other apps.\nOnly if you start a line with : does shh interpret the line as a command. So, its unlikely you'll accidentally run commands you don't intend to if you roll over your keyboard while sleeping.\nEverything you type will be there waiting for you in the morning, so leave yourself notes, dream diaries, action items, whatever it is that you need to get out of your head so late at night.\nEven if you accidentally fall asleep on the delete key, thereby deleting everything you typed (ahh!), in the morning you will still be able to view the notes you typed since every character is logged.\nRunning Commands To run a command, start a new line with a colon (:) followed by the command name, and then the command arguments.\nFor example, type :help in the shh shell to get a full list of supported commands.\nSome of my favorite commands are time, m (short for music), say, and at.\nHere are some of the commands I'll type frequently:\n :time  This will cause the shell to read the date and time aloud.   :m billy joel  This will immediately cause some Billy Joel music from YouTube to start playing. Most songs and artists should work.   :at 9:30am :m billy joel  This will set an alarm for 9:30am the following morning. At that time, it will execute the command m billy joel, which will cause some Billy Joel music from YouTube to start playing. What a nice way to wake up! The shell is forgiving about small changes to syntax such as added spaces, so don't worry about getting the commands exactly right.   :say hi  I use this as a test that my hands are aligned properly with the keyboard. If it doesn't say \u0026ldquo;hi\u0026rdquo;, that probably means my hands are offset from the keys and I typed a bit of gibberish. The command :status serves the same purpose, but just says \u0026ldquo;ok\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;hi\u0026rdquo;.    Using the \u0026ldquo;at\u0026rdquo; command The \u0026ldquo;at\u0026rdquo; command is useful because it allows you to simply schedule other commands to run at a designated time in the future.\nTo use the at command, type :at \u0026lt;when\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;command\u0026gt;. It's OK if \u0026lt;when\u0026gt; has a colon in the middle, e.g. \u0026lt;when\u0026gt; could be 7:30am. It could also be tomorrow at 9am \u0026ndash; the syntax for \u0026lt;when\u0026gt; is flexible. \u0026lt;command\u0026gt; can be any of the commands shh supports, such as alarm for playing music from youtube. E.g. :at 7:30am : alarm would schedule a musical alarm for 7:30am the following day.\nAdding new commands You can easily add new commands by adding new functions to shh_commands.py.\nSimply add a function decorated with the @command decorator to add a new command to your shh shell. If your command accepts arguments, include {} in the format string for your command, and the user's arguments will be passed to your function when the command is run.\nTroubleshooting One common mistake is to start typing a command in the middle of a line. When in doubt about whether you are at the start of a line, just hit enter. You cannot go by the visual representation in the black box \u0026ndash; all that is is a text field, but it doesn't necessarily represent the internal state of your shell. So, just hit enter, then type your command, beginning with a colon.\nThere is no concept of a cursor in shh. The arrow keys don't do anything. So even if the cursor in the text box appears to be in the middle of a line, in practice you are always typing at the end of the current content and the logged text will reflect this.\nFor additional issues, please open an Issue on GitHub.\nInstalling the Shh Shell Head on over to https://github.com/dbieber/shh-shell for instructions on how to set up the shh shell.\nA bit of backstory Why did you create a non-visual shell? There was a time during undergrad when I was losing sleep to thoughts swirling around in my head. \u0026ldquo;Does she like me?\u0026quot;, \u0026ldquo;I should have responded in this slightly different way,\u0026rdquo; etc. Variations on a theme would rattle around in my head, each variation only slightly different from thoughts I had already thought. How could I make them stop?\nI found that writing down my thoughts helped stop this rattling. Once a single canonical representation of the thought was written on paper, that was sufficient for my brain. It stopped feeling the need to iterate on the thought, and it let me get to sleep.\nHowever, writing on paper in the dark meant that in the morning, I couldn't easily read what I had written. My handwriting at night was slanted and somewhat illegible.\nI tried turning the lights on to write down my thoughts, but I didn't like how that woke me up. I tried notepad apps on my phone for writing down my thoughts, but my phone is bright and this was not much better than turning the lights on and using paper.\nSo, I started typing on my computer with the monitor off. This was a great solution, but it came with it's own problem: I needed to know if I was typing in the right window. Hence, shh shell was born. The gradual addition of commands over time has an added bonus that makes shh shell even more useful for me.\nIsn't the audio annoying to anyone else trying to sleep? Yes, my college roommate Harvest can attest to the annoyance of hearing repeated \u0026ldquo;focused\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;focus lost\u0026rdquo; throughout the night.\nI cannot in good conscience recommend use of shh shell when sleeping with your significant other.\nWhat have you typed into your shh shell? When I first started typing at night back in 2014, I wasn't used to typing without visual feedback. So in the morning when I went to look at what I had typed, I was surprised to find a large paragraph of complete gibberish! My hands had been offset by a key or so on the keyboard as I was typing. To me, it looked like a cryptographic code. Only the final line of the text was readable: \u0026ldquo;I hope the FBI doesn't find out about this.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat made this particularly cool for me was that I had no recollection of what I had typed the night before. What was I concerned about the FBI finding out!?\nDecoding the paragrah wasn't too challenging, since each letter was just off by one or so on the keyboard, and so I was soon able to figure out what I had typed. It was an amazing experience decoding this, because as I did so, my memory came back. The text was a description of a dream that I had woken up from and typed into shh before falling back asleep. I was not involved in any criminal activity :).\nBefore I decoded the mysterious paragraph, I had forgotten entirely about the dream. As I decoded though, I remembered the dream, waking from it, and writing down what had happened.\nSince then, I've now gotten used to typing in the dark and using the little bumps on the F and J keys to guide my hands. So, I don't have to decode mysterious passages about hiding secrets from the FBI anymore. I have now repeatedly experienced not remembering having typed something until I see what I typed in the morning, and each time the memory of typing it comes back as I read what I wrote. This hasn't ceased to be a very cool feeling each time it occurs.\nConclusion While I built this for myself, I have made it open source in the hope that you too may benefit from it. I hope it helps someone out there get a better night's sleep or remember a key idea they would have forgotten. Definitely check out the shh shell on GitHub and give it a try if you're Python-inclined. And as always, feel free to get in touch if you want to discuss this project or anything else.\n","date":1407024000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1407024000,"objectID":"282066a74a91073b2f9e2a45bca88f7d","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/projects/shh-shell/","publishdate":"2014-08-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/shh-shell/","section":"projects","summary":"The soothing shell for while you sleep.","tags":["Software","Productivity"],"title":"shh Shell","type":"projects"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Scrabble Bot loves Scrabble and social media!

The authors are my coworkers: Alex Alemi, Ian Fischer, Joshua Dillon, and Kevin Murphy.\nI've taken notes on the paper, and will use this snippet to present them.\nNotation We consider the problem of supervised learning for classification with the following notation:\n $X$: An example input. $Z$: The output of an intermediate layer of a neural network.  We view this as a stochastic encoding of $X$. It is the output of a parametric encoder $p(\\textbf{z} | \\textbf{x}; \\theta)$ $\\theta$ are the parameters of the neural network used to encode $X$ that we wish to learn.   $Y$: The example's target class.  Goal The approach of the paper aims first and foremost to learn an encoding $Z$ of $X$ that is maximally informative about $Y$. This is measured via mutual information between $Z$ and $Y$: $I(Z, Y; \\theta)$.\n$$I(Z, Y; \\theta) = \\int dx~dy~p(z, y|\\theta) \\log \\frac{p(z, y)}{p(z)p(y)}$$\nIt's not enough to maximize $I(Z, Y; \\theta)$ though; this can be done by simply letting $Z = X$, which isn't useful.\nSo, we also want to limit $I(Z, X)$. We do this by enforcing an information constraint: $I(X, Z) \u0026lt; I_c$.\nOur goal is to maximize $I(Z, Y; \\theta)$ subject to $I(X, Z) \u0026lt; I_c$.\nRewriting this using Lagrange multiplier $\\beta$ brings us to the information bottleneck (IB) objective, which we write as follows:\n$$R_{IB}(\\theta) = I(Z,Y) - \\beta I(Z, X).$$\nThe goal of the paper is to maximize $R_{IB}$.\nIntuition Behind Goal Why maximize $I(Z, Y)$? This is what allows the model to make correct predictions.\nWhy not just maximize $I(Z, Y)$? Letting $Z = X$ fully maximizes $I(Z, Y)$, but isn't helpful because the representation of $Z$ is what you started with, so its hard to make good classifications.\nWhy minimize $\\beta I(Z, X)$? We want a representation $Z$ that is maximally compressive of the input $X$.\nThat's the intuition given in the paper for why we seek to minimize $\\beta I(Z, X)$, but it isn't clear the degree to which compression is useful. Yes, a compressive representation of $X$ can lead to better generalization, but it's a trade off. Greater compression may mean lower $I(Z, Y)$ and hence lower potential accuracy. Balancing this trade off (choosing an appropriate $\\beta$) will be important.\nWhy is it difficult? Mutual information is in general intractable. So we can't directly optimize the object $R_{IB}(\\theta)$ as stated in the goal. Instead, the paper takes the following approach to get around mutual information's intractability.\nThe Approach   Use variational inference to construct a lower bound on the IB objective.\n  Use the \u0026ldquo;reparameterization trick\u0026rdquo; and Monte Carlo sampling to get unbiased estimate of gradient.\n  Parameterize our distributions with neural networks, and optimize with SGD.\n  We'll go into more detail in just a minute.\nBenefits This approach provides some robustness to overfitting because model ignores as much of $X$ as possible.\nIt also provides some robustness to adversarial examples because the model maps $X$ to a distribution over $Z$s rather than a single $Z$, so its harder for a single unusual value to influence a final class prediction.\nExecution Part 1: Variational Inference You can follow the math in the paper (Section 3), but the first main result is to define\n$$L = \\int dx~dy~dz~ p(x) p(y|x) p(z|x) \\log q(y|z) - \\beta \\int dx~dz~ p(x) p(z|x) \\log \\frac{p(z|x)}{r(z)}$$\nand show that $$R_{IB}(\\theta) = I(Z,Y) - \\beta I(Z, X) \\ge L.$$\nTo achieve this, we've introduced $q(y|z)$ as an approximation of $p(y|z)$, and $r(z)$ as an approximation of $p(z)$.\n$L$ serves as a lower bound for the objective we care about. $p$, $q$, and $r$ are all parameterized by $\\theta$.\nWe can approximate $L$ as\n$$L \\approx \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=1}^N \\left[\\int dz~ p(z|x_n) \\log q(y_n|z) - \\beta~ p(z|x_n) \\log \\frac{p(z|x_n)}{r(z)} \\right].$$\nPart 2: Reparameterization trick Suppose $p(z|x)$ is $N(z|f_e^\\mu(x), f_e^\\Sigma(x))$, with $f_e$ a neural network that outputs the mean and covariance matrix for the Gaussian.\nThen the \u0026ldquo;reparameterization trick\u0026rdquo; is to write $p(z|x)dz = p(\\epsilon)d\\epsilon$, where $z = f(x, \\epsilon)$ is a deterministic function and $\\epsilon$ is a Gaussian random variable. Using this, we can rewrite $L$ as follows.\n$$J_{IB} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum\\limits_{n=1}^N E_{\\epsilon \\sim p(\\epsilon)} \\left[-\\log q(y_n|f(x_n,\\epsilon))\\right] + \\beta KL[p(Z|x_n), r(Z)]$$\nAs long as $q$ is differentiable and $KL[p(Z|x_n), r(Z)]$ is tractable, this is an objective we can optimize with e.g. gradient descent.\nImplementation A concise demo implementation is available on GitHub at https://github.com/alexalemi/vib_demo/blob/master/MNISTVIB.ipynb.\nI've describe here the correspondence between the notation used in the source code and the notation used in the paper. Terms from the paper are in $\\LaTeX$, and terms from the source code are in code blocks.\n class_loss: $-\\log q(y_n | f(x_n, \\epsilon))$ (comes from the $I(Z, Y)$ term)  Recall $z = f(x, \\epsilon)$; this is encoding.sample() in the code base. $q$ is decoder with softmax applied, and $q(y | f(x_n, \\epsilon))$ is softmax(logits) class_loss = tf.losses.softmax_cross_entropy( logits=logits, onehot_labels=one_hot_labels) / math.log(2) is $-\\log q(y_n | f(x_n, \\epsilon))$  $f$ is encoder, and $f(x, \\cdot)$ is encoding   $p(Z|x_n)$ is also encoding $f$ is the deterministic encoder used by the reparameterization trick, whereas $p$ is the stochastic encoder   $KL[p(Z|x_n), r(Z)]$ is info_loss prior is $r(z)$ (which approximates $p(z)$).

In this post, I share an idea I have for a plugin or browser extension that I think would improve the experience of taking notes in Roam while browsing the web.\nThe plugin would do two main things automatically:\n  It would automatically insert some browsing history information into your Roam database while you browse the internet.\n  As you navigate the web, it would automatically bring you to the Roam page that corresponds to the web page you're reading.\n  Mind the Details Of course, the implementation details matter! You don't want to be whisked away from the notes you're taking just because you've linked a link in a different window.\nSo, here I'll explain a few of the details I think would make this a good note taking experience.\nAs I'm browsing the internet, all the websites I visit will get added to a page \u0026ldquo;{Date} Browsing History\u0026rdquo;. A new Roam page will be created for each new website visited. And there will be a Roam window that always stays open to the Roam page for the current website I have open in my browser.\nWhat qualifies as a website?\nBy default there would be one Roam page per domain visited. However, there are several exceptions:\n For Wikipedia it would be one Roam page per Wikipedia entry For websites reached from HackerNews, Twitter, and Reddit, it would be one Roam page per link followed from the aggregator (but links followed within the reached website would not count as new websites) For GitHub it would be one Roam page per user, organization, or repo visited For Arxiv it would be one Roam page per paper For Roam it would be one Roam page per Roam database  It will be great to have a window that always stays open to the Roam page for the current website I have open in my browser. This way if I visit a website I've been to before, I will see my notes from that website. And the websites I visit will be linked to the day I visit them on, and also to any other pages my notes reference.\nAdditionally, the tool should add a little bit of metadata to the pages it's generating. On each of the autogenerated Roam pages, it would be great to see when I visited the website, and what was the referring page. For websites visited multiple times, seeing the earliest and most recent visit times, and the number of times I visited that website would be useful too. Total time spent on the website would be a nice bonus.\nMaking this a Reality In the previous section I shared the details that I think would make this work well from a user experience perspective. How about from the technical side?\nI think it would make sense to implement this as a browser extension (though a user script could work too). DK the Human, author of the Intention browser extension has made his browser extension starter kit freely available. To notice when what web page you're browsing and determine whether it constitutes a new page, the extension would need to request permission to view your activity on all websites. For making additions to a Roam database automatically, I expect the extension would have to navigate to the appropriate Roam page in the background, and would then mimic the user actions to make the desired changes.\nIf you're interested in turning this idea into a reality or want to discuss it further, don't hesitate to reach out! I'd be excited to try a workflow like this, but don't anticipate building it myself in the near future.\n","date":1589500800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589500800,"objectID":"d641e287abdbf006fbf86c25d4174f54","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-05-15-roaming-the-web/","publishdate":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2020-05-15-roaming-the-web/","section":"snippets","summary":"As I'm browsing the web, I'd like to be able to take notes in Roam Research.

Note that in Roam, children are referred to as \u0026ldquo;blocks\u0026rdquo;, and a child's ID is the ID used to reference a block.\nLast but not least, I include the emoji reaction schema 😂.\nEmoji Schema Each Emoji reaction to a child is an object conforming to the following schema.\n   Key Type Description     emoji object An object with a single key native containing the emoji itself.   users List[object] A list of objects indicating who added this emoji and when. The keys are time (ms since epoch) and email (the email of the user who added the reaction).    Missing Information Some information appears to get lost in the export. In particular, the following information appears to be dropped.\n \u0026ldquo;View as Document\u0026rdquo; / \u0026ldquo;View as Numbered List\u0026rdquo;: This formatting information doesn't seem to get exported. Versions. If you're using the \u0026ldquo;versions\u0026rdquo; feature of Roam, the versions don't seem to be exported either.  Implications of the JSON Format Since Roam allows export of its data in such a simple format, you can easily write scripts for processing this data. For example, merging two databases is trivial. I include some simple such scripts in the following section.\nThe clear export also means that you will continue to be able to use your data long into the future, even if Roam shuts down or otherwise becomes unavailable to you. As long as you occasionally back up your data by exporting it, it is yours forever.\nUseful Python Snippets for Processing Roam JSON Once you've downloaded your data as JSON from Roam, you can load and manipulate it as follows.\nLoad JSON import json filepath = '/path/to/roam-database.json' data = json.load(open(filepath))  Collect All Children children = [] blocks = data.copy() while blocks: block = blocks.pop() if 'children' in block: blocks.extend(block['children']) children.extend(block['children'])  Find All Notes Mentioning \u0026ldquo;Roam\u0026rdquo; for child in children: if 'roam' in child.get('string', '').lower(): print(child['string'])  Merge Two Databases Since databases are just lists of objects, you can trivially merge them.\nmerged = db1 + db2  It's possible this will result in multiple pages having the same name, but Roam deals with this just fine.\nThank You Roam I want to conclude with a note of thanks to the Roam developers for allowing export in such a clear and readily understandable manner. Doing so inspires confidence that I will be able to continue using the notes I take in Roam far into the future, no matter what. This makes me so much more comfortable using Roam for my note taking. Props and thank you to the Roam developers for this feature.\n","date":1587772800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587772800,"objectID":"33081e18ec301c6760239a0662d31e7d","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-25-roam-json-export/","publishdate":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2020-04-25-roam-json-export/","section":"snippets","summary":"Roam Research is a note taking tool that makes it really low-friction to take deeply interwoven notes.

However, it wasn't obvious to me how to get media sources to play their audio.\nWhen using a Media Source, here's out to turn on the audio. In the Audio Mixer panel choose Gear Settings \u0026gt; Advanced Audio Properties then set Audio Monitoring to \u0026ldquo;Monitor and Output\u0026rdquo;.\nNamespaces for Scenes + Turning Off the Camera You can create multiple Profiles and Scene Collections in OBS. I only have one Profile, which I've named \u0026ldquo;Default\u0026rdquo; (rather than the default of \u0026ldquo;Untitled\u0026rdquo;). I made a few Scene Collections. Making new Scene Collections gives you a space to play around with new ideas for scenes and keyboard shortcuts, without disrupting the main setup(s) that you've put together. I like to fiddle around with new ideas in a Scene Collection I've named \u0026ldquo;Playground\u0026rdquo;.\nIf you have any sources in a Scene Collection that use your webcam, then your webcam will stay on even when it isn't being used. If you switch to a Scene Collection with no sources using your webcam, then your webcam will turn off. I use a Scene Collection that leaves my webcam off by default, and only switch to a Scene Collection with a webcam source when I actually intend to record something that needs the webcam.\nReplay Buffer I leave the replay buffer on in between recording scenes. By setting the replay buffer to a reasonable size like 60 seconds, I can leave it rolling without consuming too much memory (and the CPU consumption has been reasonable too, e.g. 10%). This way, if anything noteworthy happens in this period between recordings, I can still capture it.\nVirtual Cameras If you're willing to get your hands dirty, the instructions at johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam will let you use OBS as a virtual camera on Mac.\nTransform Editing and Scene .json files cmd-e opens the Scene Item Transform for a Scene Item.

On Mac, these scene json files can be found at ~/Library/Application Support/obs-studio/basic/scenes.\nKeyboard Shortcuts cmd-, opens your settings. There's a panel for setting keyboard shortcuts. This is a core OBS feature, and it's extremely valuable.

I use a Mac, and historically there hasn't been a good way to use OBS as a virtual camera. With @tobi\u0026lsquo;s recent $10,000 bounty for making this a core feature, however, some developers in the OBS community leapt into action and a working prototype of the feature was available on GitHub within days.\nVirtual Cameras OBS is popular software among Twitch streamers. It lets you take a bunch of video sources and rearrange them into scenes. Streamers will often overlay a camera feed of their head and a live stream of a video game, maybe with cool graphics overlaid on the whole thing.\nFor years, OBS has let you take the scenes you create and stream them in real time to YouTube Live or Twitch or any number of other streaming services. If you wanted to use your OBS scene in Zoom or Google Meet, however, it wasn't straightforward, at least on Mac.\nThere were workarounds. You could project your scene to an external monitor, and then use screen sharing to share that. At times there were combinations of tools and plugins that could similarly get the job done.\nNow, however, it's considerably easier. John Boiles's has made a OBS plugin that works without fuss. For now it still requires a technical background to use, following build instructions and executing commands on the terminal to get it set up. In a matter of months, however, I expect it will make its way as a core feature into OBS.\nCombining OBS with Auto Video Editing As you may know, I've been working on automatic video editing software. I'd like to be able to make quality content \u0026ndash; e.g. videos teaching interesting aspects of programming \u0026ndash; without needing to spend time on the video editing process. The cutting and rearranging would happen automatically. The music and audio adjustments would be added automatically. All I'd need to do is write a script and record the footage, and the auto editor would take care of the rest.\nOriginally I was using Mac's cmd-shift-5 screen capture capability to create these recordings. OBS lets you rearrange video feeds deliberately and use a variety of video sources. These video sources include window captures, cameras, and prerecorded media. The result is much more flexible than Mac's screen capture, and so I've switched my auto video editing software over to use OBS for recording.\nAs an aside, I've also discovered NDI, a plugin for OBS. It lets me use my phone's camera as a video source with minimal setup. It was so easy to get working, in fact, that I'm convinced it must be a large security vulnerability to use it at all.\nNow that I'm using OBS to record, I enabled my auto video editing software to run automatically on any recording produced by OBS. As soon as the recording gets saved, my software starts editing it automatically (preserving the original). I'd love to have my auto editing start even sooner than that though, before the recording is complete. The OBS codebase is surprisingly approachable, so I may be able to get this working.\nHacking on the OBS Codebase When John Boiles released the Mac Virtual Cam plugin for OBS, it was initially stuck on the wrong resolution. John told me it was hard coded to 720x480, and that was the impetus for me to poke at the code. Changing the hard coded resolution proved easy enough. Then I ran into a bug where OBS would fail to capture a window if I changed tabs in that window while OBS was closed. Though there's inertia with entering any unfamiliar codebase, I found I was able to solve this issue for myself too. Through these two debugging experiences I got enough glimpses of the OBS plugin set up to think that OBS really is approachably hackable. I think, with hard work, I could integrate my auto editing code into OBS so that it runs in real time. It's not the very top of my todo list for the auto video editor, but I'm excited to give this a try.\nReplay Buffers in OBS One neat feature in OBS is its ability to record a \u0026ldquo;replay buffer\u0026rdquo;. I have it set up to record a circular buffer of the last 60 seconds of content. That means that at any given moment, OBS has recorded the previous 60 seconds of footage. Unsaved footage older than 60 seconds is gone, but at any point, if I choose to save it, I can record the previous 60 seconds of footage.\nThis is great because it means I can keep the camera rolling between scenes without wasting memory, and if anything noteworthy happens in that time I can capture it.\nThere's a second reason I'm excited about the replay buffer though; it may enable me to use auto-edited videos in conversations in real time. I imagine the user experience like this: I'm in a remote meeting and we're having a discussion. By default I'm unmuted and people can hear what I'm saying. Whenever I hold down a keyboard shortcut, I'm muted in the call and OBS starts recording me. When I release the shortcut, I can continue to talk in the call. Once I've recorded a satisfactory amount of content for OBS, the auto-editing will be applied and I can use OBS as a virtual camera to send that recorded and edited content to my colleagues in the meeting.\nLooking Forward I'm excited to become more proficient using OBS, and to explore the various plugins and overlays that streamers use with OBS. Particularly I'm excited to look into the audio plugins that are available.\nI also intend to continue my auto-editing plans from before: I'm still looking forward to introducing a \u0026ldquo;script\u0026rdquo; with audio auto-transcribed and key events entered via keyboard shortcuts and auto-tracked file saves. And I still want to be able to modify this script to automatically edit the video based on the modifications.\nHaving explored OBS for a little while now, I'm also looking forward to integrating my auto-video editing more closely with OBS, ideally resulting in real time auto editing in the end. Here's to hoping OBS continues to feel approachably hackable!\n","date":1586390400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586390400,"objectID":"0d7b0e395a9057b5b6f29a8fa38a8c87","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-09-exploring-obs/","publishdate":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2020-04-09-exploring-obs/","section":"snippets","summary":"This week I've been exploring Open Broadcasting Software (OBS) and toying with using it as a virtual camera.

I've set it up several times before, and each time I encounter it it's a bit of a mental mess to wrap my mind around it again.\nSo, this time, as I set up OAuth2 to let Bieber Bot interact with more Slack workspaces, I will write up my renewed understanding of OAuth2 in the hope that next time I have to set up OAuth2, it's a little easier.\nOverview of the OAuth2 Flow How does the OAuth2 flow go? Like this:\nThe user wants to add Bieber Bot to a Slack channel. So, they're on my website (davidbieber.com) and they click the Add to Slack button. This takes them to Slack, with GET parameters that indicate they want to add Bieber Bot to some Slack workspace. The workspace id can be part of the URL of the Add to Slack button, but even if it's not, Slack will do the right thing and just ask the user to choose one of their workspaces. If the user isn't already logged in to Slack, they'll be prompted to do so at this point.\nAfter the user clicks the Add to Slack button they are taken to Slack, where they are shown the list of OAuth2 scopes that Bieber Bot is requesting. If they approve giving Bieber Bot the permissions listed in the scopes, they are taken to a redirect url that I, the developer of Bieber Bot, have specified. I have both pre-informed Slack of the redirect URLs I might use, and I have included a specific redirect URL in the link on the Add to Slack button. When the user is redirected to this redirect url, two GET parameters are included. The first is a code, which my server can use to get an Access Token / Bearer Token. The second is a state which is something that I, the developer, can include on the original link from the Add to Slack button in order to make sure the request I'm getting at the redirect URL is genuine.\nWhen the redirect URL is accessed with a code GET parameter, it then turns around and uses that code to request an Access Token from Slack. Once it has that Access Token, it tucks it away. It can use that access token in order to perform any of the permissions granted by the user during the access flow.\nUsually using the Access Token takes the form of issuing post requests to Slack with the Access Token as a parameter.\nThe user can revoke access to Bieber Bot at any time. Once they do so, the Access Token becomes invalid. If Bieber Bot tries to use the Access Token at that point, it will get an error. The user will have to give Bieber Bot permissions again, and it will get a new access token, in order for it to continue providing its services and companionship.\nSummary of the the Important Bits  User navigates from website to service (e.g. via Add to Slack button). Service shows user permissions dialog. Upon accepting permissions, service redirects user back to website's redirect URL with code Website uses code to get Access Token Website uses Access Token to do the stuff allowed by the permissions granted by the user  Summary of the Less Important Bits   The Add to Slack button should include GET parameters for: a) state so the redirect url knows the request is genuine, b) redirect_url so Slack knows where to send the user after they accept the permissons, c) scope indicating the permissions being requested, d) client_id indicating the app (e.g. Bieber Bot) that you're adding to Slack.\n  The permissions that the App can request are set up by the App ahead of time. So I think the scope parameter is there if you only need to request a subset of that permissions for a particular user.\n  The full list of possible redirect URLs should be set up ahead of time. Then when you generate the Add to Slack button, you just choose a particular redirect URL that Slack should redirect the user to after they accept the permissions. Why would you want more than one redirect URL? Well, one might be for staging, one for production, and one for local development.\n  The redirect URL receives both the code and state GET parameters. The website creating the Add to Slack button decides on the state. It can then check that the state is there in the redirect URL. This prevents users from going directly to Slack without going through the website, because if they try to do that, they won't have the state and will fail the check at the redirect URL. This is useful if you want to restrict installs for your App to specific customers, e.g. those who've solved a puzzle, or paid.\n  What is this? This certainly isn't meant to be an OAuth2 guide at all. By writing this out, I think I've helped myself understand the OAuth2 flow better though. That's really what snippets are all about.\n","date":1584662400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584662400,"objectID":"50e178007fafc223bdf9dc227229fe98","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-03-20-understanding-oauth2/","publishdate":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2020-03-20-understanding-oauth2/","section":"snippets","summary":"OAuth2 is confusing.

He intends to listen to these audiobooks at 2x - 3x speed. Intense!\nFor the last few weeks, I've been working on automatic video editing tools. And one of the core features I've been working with is automatic speed adjustments to videos to eliminate silent airtime and make the videos more engaging. This seems like a perfect fit for Aaron's challenge.\nI've adapted this tooling into a new tool I'm calling Fastbook. It accepts audiobooks in the form of .wav files, and can apply speed adjustments to the silence and the spoken word independently, even removing silence entirely if desired.\nIf Aaron can already comfortably (with great focus) listen to a book at 2.5x speed, he can listen to a 10 hour book in 4 hours. If 20% of that book is actually silence, then the 10 hour book becomes an 8 hour book with silence removed, and the total listen time drops to just 3h12. I think 20% may actually be a conservative estimate for silent time, though it will vary from narrator to narrator.\nEstimating 45 minutes saved per book, this tool can save over 3 days total time across 100 books. Or, alternatively, Aaron could drop the playback speed down from 2.5x to 2x without increasing his total listening time at all, but potentially helping out his comprehension substantially.\nThis tool wont be appropriate for all audiobook listeners. For many, the silences matter, and removing them would degrade the quality of the book. For many, listening at 2.5x would also degrade the quality of the book. So use this tool with caution.\nFor those of you who are intersted, however, here's how to use Fastbook.\nInstalling Fastbook I've made Fastbook available for free on GitHub. You can access it here.\nTo use it, save it to your computer as fastbook.py.\nNext, make sure you have all the dependencies installed. See the dependencies section for what is required.\nPre-work: Converting Your Book to .wav You need your audiobook in wav format to use Fastbook.\nTo convert an audiobook to wav, use ffmpeg.\nInstall ffmpeg. Then, run ffmpeg -i book.aax book.wav to convert an Audible audiobook to a wav file. There may be an additional step if your aax file is DRM protected.\nUsing Fastbook Now you can use Fastbook like this:\npython fastbook.py \\ --audio_path=/path/to/book.wav \\ --output_path=/path/to/book-fast.wav \\ --loud_speed=1 \\ --quiet_speed=5  --audio_path should point to an existing wav file that you downloaded or generated in the pre-work section. --output_path is the path to the file that Fastbook will generate. Finally, --loud_speed is how much to speed up the normal spoke text of the book by, and --quiet_speed is how much to speed up the silence in the book by. You can remove silence by setting --quiet_speed=99999 or any other similiarly large number.\nDependencies Here are the dependencies you need to use Fastbook.\nFirst, you need Python 3. You can follow these instructions to set up Python 3 if you don't already have it installed.\nThen, you need these Python depenencies: fire, scipy, tqdm, numpy, and audiotsm. Install these with pip install fire scipy tqdm numpy audiotsm or use your favorite Python package manager.\nFinally, to do the pre-work, you will likely need ffmpeg. Installation instructions are available here.\nRead quick! I recommend for Aaron to use the default speed settings of --loud_speed=1 --quiet_speed=5. This wont eliminate the silence entirely, but will reduce the audio time considerably. Then, for the remaining speed-up, I suggest using whatever media player you were already using, such as VLC which supports arbitrary speed adjustments in real time.

Every time I save a file during a screen recording session, the change is immediately and automatically committed. The commit message is selected automatically from the diff. The result is that I have a timestamped log of all changes made during the recording. This is super useful for editing the recordings (both automatically and manually) because I can pinpoint exactly where in the recording any change took place. It also works hand-in-hand with the next piece of tooling.\nKeyboard Shortcuts Just using Auto Auto-Jumpcutter goes a long way toward having automatically edited videos, but it doesn't completely eliminate the need for manual editing. For example, it provides no way to do multiple takes and stitch together the good parts of each. For this I've set up a keyboard shortcut system for myself using the Python keyboard module. This way I can indicate via keyboard shortcuts to remove a selection of footage during the recording session, and have it automatically be removed during the automatic editing phase. This last step \u0026ndash; using the keyboard shortcuts to guide automatic editing \u0026ndash; is an active work in progress.\n","date":1582675200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582675200,"objectID":"ea02fe603b92ce0066ce2b46885822cb","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-02-26-video-tooling-progress/","publishdate":"2020-02-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2020-02-26-video-tooling-progress/","section":"snippets","summary":"Over the last week and a half I've been making screen recordings of myself programming.

External Monitor: I purchased an external monitor. This made a huge difference. Now I can manage video-editing tools, a terminal, a browser, etc on one screen, while keeping the contents of the video (the editor and public terminal) on the other screen and recording it.\n  carykh/jumpcutter: This tool can automatically speed up the silent parts of a video, resulting in shorter less-boring videos.\n  Mac Screen Capture: cmd-shift-5 lets you capture video on Mac. You can choose what directory the captured video is saved to. Before I discovered this, I used QuickTime, but this is easier to use.\n  Using watchdog This is a Python module that can monitor your filesystem and trigger an action when files are created or modified. I use it to a) automatically rename video files as they're created, and b) to automatically apply jumpcutting to new captured videos. The filename format I use is YYYY-MM-DD-screen-recording-###.mov.\n  Python Fire: The first twenty clips I recorded (not released) were all of me building the tooling I now use as I record videos. Most of this tooling lives in Python Fire CLIs. These CLIs let me do things like composite audio, perform auto-jumpcutting, and rename videos.\n  Things to improve:   Zoom in! The code is blurry and small and the video as is needs to be watched at 1080p to look OK, which is silly.\n  Audio Quality I have a lapel mic I'm using for new recordings and it helps.\n  Storytelling Is a Python Fire CLI for adding and subtracting the most compelling story? I think there's room for improvement.\n  Manual Editing I did no manual editing for the clip above. I think for quality videos, however, learning to do some manual editing is going to be essential. We'll see how far my inclination to automate everything takes me first though.\n   I'm really enjoying this process of recording videos. And more than making the videos, I'm enjoying building the software to help me make the videos. Next step for me is getting more familiar with moviepy. And Davinci Resolve.

In box A is either $1 million or 0, in box B there is $1000.\nYou're told, choose either just box A or both A and B.\nYou keep the contents of the boxes you choose. Also, the host knows what box you will choose, and has placed $1 million in A if you will choose only A, and $0 in A if you will choose both A and B.\nSome contestants, faced with this choice, would choose both A and B. They reason that since the money has already been placed, choosing A and B is guaranteed to yield $1000 more than choosing just A. Others would choose only A, since per the host's plans this option leads to a significantly better payout.\nClearly choosing only A is $1000 worse than choosing both A and B, yet choosing A only is allegedly better given the host's foresight. These statements appear contradictory, and this situation is known as Newcomb's Paradox. How can we reconcile these two true but contradictory statements?\nWe do so by clarifying:\n Right now choosing only A is $1000 worse than choosing both A and B. However, having a brain1 at the time the money is placed that will lead you to choose only A at the time of choosing gives the $1 million outcome.  Is this something you have control over? Can you decide at the time the money is placed to have a brain that will lead you to later choose only box A?\nYes.\nIt may seem like no, for a few reasons:\n You didn't even know there was a choice to make. You surely don't get to make choices about how your brain works, right? Since the host is able know your choice ahead of time, that must mean it's predetermined, right?  However, none of these reasons are entirely valid.\nFirst, it's true that at the time the money is placed, you didn't necessarily know you had a choice to make. You hadn't yet been informed that you would later be on this gameshow. However, it's possible you considered the situation as a hypothetical anyway (maybe while reading a blog post, for instance). It isn't necessary that you considered precisely the situation that you would later find yourself in, only that you've given conscious deliberate thought to the way you make choices. By thinking this through, you can decide now whether you have a brain that would later choose box A or one that would later choose both A and B, should the gameshow situation ever arise.\nNext, you absolutely do get to make choices about how your brain works. You can choose when to sleep, when to study, what substances to ingest, and most importantly, what to focus your attention on. All of these levers are yours to pull, and they all affect how your brain will operate in the future.\nAt the time you choose the boxes, it's still your decision as to which box(es) to choose. (In the sense that it's your brain that produces the decision.) But you must have been predictable, at least to the host, for them to have predicted what choice you would later make. (Nothing wrong with being predictable!)\nHow is it that you were predictable? Does this require determinism? One extreme way you may have been predictable is if the host knows exactly how events will play out, right down to the thoughts you will have and the choices you will make.\nIt doesn't have to be quite so extreme though. The host only claimed to have roughly one bit of information about you and the future: what binary choice you would make when confronted with the box dilemma. That doesn't require omniscience. The host may have no idea what the weather is going to be the next day, as long as they're able to predict whether or not you're taking box B.\nSo maybe they know a little about how your mind works, or they've read something you've posted online that lets them conclude how you will handle the box situation.\nYou must consider that whatever they know, they knew it at the time that they chose how to fill the boxes. (They likely also knew it at the time they chose to host the gameshow in the first place.)\nWhat I think is most likely is that this host does know precisely how you think about this choice. They do this by understanding to a very high degree of precision how your brain is going to cope with the decision of which boxes to choose. Think of the host as a very skilled poker player, that can read you like a book. Instead of just knowing whether you're bluffing or not, they know what you're going to think before you even think it. It's like weather forecasting, but instead of understanding the atmosphere, they're understanding you.\nAnd like with weather forecasting, their model is imperfect. It's good enough to know what box you'll choose, with certainty, but only because that only requires forecasting a small window (a week, let's say) into the future. Like the atmospheric conditions that determine the weather, your brain is a chaotic system. Any imperfection in the model, however small, will eventually blow up and lead to large errors in the model in the future. So our host can't model your every thought a year into the future, let alone e.g. the whole population's behaviors.\nSo what boxes should you choose?\nYou should choose to open just box A. By reaching this conclusion (and more importantly, by adopting the strategy for reasoning that leads to this conclusion), you guarantee yourself $1 million the next time you encounter a wealthy generous time travelling gameshow host interested in philosophy and mathematics.\n  I say \u0026ldquo;brain\u0026rdquo;, but I really mean the whole of your situation and life circumstances. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1581120000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581120000,"objectID":"c9afce39bad6f3ad11fd9aeb1160c67c","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-02-08-future-gameshow-host/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2020-02-08-future-gameshow-host/","section":"snippets","summary":"A gameshow host reveals 2 boxes, box A and box B.

You'll notice it's in the snippets section of the website, rather than part of the main blog. This gives me the freedom to post it even though I know it's not as polished as it could be.\nNow that this first pass is published, it's time to start thinking about where to go next with Ask Me Anywhere.\nShort Term: Stylistic Improvements On mobile, the \u0026ldquo;Click to React\u0026rdquo; text shows up and is improperly styled. I didn't intend for it to show up at all. On certain mobile devices and browsers, it seems there are even larger issues than this, such as double tapping sometimes not working at all. Let me know if it doesn't work with your browser so I can fix it.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Click to React\u0026rdquo; text also sometimes causes the flow of the text to change, which interrupts the reading experience somewhat. I would like to fix this so that the text flow is never changed by the presence of this message.\nI also would like to tweak the styling to minimize the friction someone feels in deciding to leave a message. I think adding a question-mark icon, which when moused-over gives an explanation of why this feature is there in the first place could be useful. This could strike a good balance between being non-intrusive and letting people know that their thoughts are warmly welcomed.\nLonger Term: \u0026ldquo;Socratic Tutorials\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Ask Me Anywhere\u0026rdquo; is really an MVP that came out of a larger idea: \u0026ldquo;Socratic Tutorials\u0026rdquo;.\nMy idea is that a Socratic Tutorial is a blog post structured in a very particular way. It begins with a brief introduction to a topic, followed by a series of questions you might want to ask about that topic. Click a question to reveal an answer to that question, followed by additional questions you might have about the topic. In this way, you can explore the contents of the post in the order that best suits your interests. I also hope that by having to click questions to view the answers, it will help motivate what you're reading, since you'll be actively wondering about the question when you read the response.\nIf a reader of a Socratic Tutorial doesn't understand something, or has a question that isn't already addressed, they can choose to ask that question. The author can then add it to the list of questions available during reading if they choose to do so. In that way, \u0026ldquo;Ask Me Anywhere\u0026rdquo; is almost a subset of the features planned for Socratic Tutorials.\nMy very first blog post ever was about Collapsible Blog Posts. The premise was that you could click on a paragraph, and it would be replaced with a summary of that paragraph. This paragraph is an example; click on it, and it will be replaced with a summary. This was a Collapsible Blog Post paragraph. Click to un-collapse. I learned early on from this experiment that the reverse process actually is more useful. Present the user with a short summary, and let them click if they want to read additional details.\nHere's an example of a short paragraph that you can click to reveal additional details. The reason it makes more sense to show the summary first is that it empowers the user to choose how to spend their time. If they are interested in understanding more about a topic, they can choose to expand the paragraph and read the details. If instead they read the extended paragraph first, there isn't much value to them also reading the summarized version. And if they just want the summarized version, having them see the full version first isn't too useful either. In some ways the idea for \u0026ldquo;Socratic Tutorials\u0026rdquo; is a spiritual descendent of Collapsible Blog Posts. They both share a goal: give the user control over the information they're consuming, as they're reading. Socratic Tutorials and Ask Me Anywhere take an additional step though, giving the user the ability to communicate directly with the author while they're reading.\nYou'll likely have noticed that this post uses \u0026ldquo;Ask Me Anywhere\u0026rdquo;. That means you can double click any paragraph, or click between two paragraphs, in order to send a note directly to the author.

It may be necessary to normalize by population to tell such a story.\nIt may seem infeasible to precisely collect this data, as there is no public registry of who is thinking about what. However, I think the data is perhaps more readily available than appears at first blush.\nWhere would the data come from?\n Search trends University enrollments Publication counts Surveys  Search trends are of course a more recent source of data, only going back one or two decades. The pre-1990s version of search trends might be library records, or book sales.\nUniversity enrollments and degrees granted tells a significant story about how many people are studying different areas. You can roughly estimate how much time a student majoring in physics puts into their studies, and if course enrollments are available that estimate can be even more precise.\nScientific fields make their mark on the world by publishing their research. Counting publications can provide an estimate of one piece of humanity's effort studying science.\nFinally, for contemporary data, and maybe even a little historical data, one could uses surveys / polling techniques to estimate where scientific mindshare is going today.\nAmong this data I'd be curious to see when historically there have been large swings in mindshare toward a particular topic. Right now, anecdotally, machine learning research is engaging a quickly increasing number of people, including drawing people away from other fields. I'd love to see this anecdotal evidence backed up (or refuted) by data. And I expect there are plenty of similar historical precidents that I would be quite interested in learning more about as well.\nI don't forsee collecting this data or performing these visualizations myself in the near future.

However, they often fall into the trap of trying to do too much. The best blog posts do one thing, and do it well. If you're writing a blog post, you should choose a single, narrow point that you want to make, and make it well.\nWhile this may seem like obviously good advice, in practice the temptation to broaden the scope of a blog post can be very real. So it is important to actively practice discretion in limiting the scope of any post.\nHow does scope creep come about? Authors may have a temptation to write about tangentially related topics. Sometimes this will be in order to provide justification or context. Other times the author simply has multiple lessons on the same topic they wish to share.\nAny one of these scenarios will lead the author to increase the scope of their writing. Even in the face of these situations, however, it is important to keep a narrow scope.\nIn this post, for example, the core message is that \u0026ldquo;when writing a blog post, you should have a narrowly scoped thesis.\u0026rdquo; It is tempting for me to then also write about how to choose that thesis. After all, this seems a natural discussion to have while explaining the importance of a narrow scope. However, this would be a dangerous move, because a good discussion about how to choose a thesis well requires giving advice like \u0026ldquo;ask yourself: what are you interested in and knowledgeable about?\u0026quot;, and \u0026ldquo;think about what your audience is likely to care about\u0026rdquo;, etc. These suggestions don't help make the core point, that your scope should be exceedingly narrow.\nIn writing this post, it is tempting to write about how \u0026ldquo;trying to do too much can lead to doing multiple things poorly\u0026rdquo; applies in other, non-writing, contexts too. This has the potential to be an insightful discussion. However, this would only serve to detract from the main point: in writing blog posts specifically, you should choose a single main point and make it well. Trying to broaden this to other contexts would weaken the argument, because the wider the context is, the more exceptions there are. If I had said \u0026ldquo;in all of life, do one thing and do it well\u0026rdquo;, people would correctly protest: that's no way to live a life, you should aim to be well-rounded. So, I strengthen my argument by narrowing its scope: in writing a blog post, pick a single thesis and defend it convincingly.\nWhy is it important to have just one main point? To start, having a single well defined main point improves the clarity of your writing. It is easier to be persuasive when you have a well-defined objective you are trying to impress upon your readers. Stray too far from this main point and it distracts the reader and weakens your piece.\nIn the age of online writing and sharing, the importance of a single clear thesis is increased. Having a well-scoped piece increases its sharability. There is no risk that the recipient of the shared article will mistake the reason for its sharing. Having a well-scoped piece also makes it easier to reference that piece in the future. One can simply link to the article if they want to leverage its argument, rather than needing to specify \u0026ldquo;in the third section of David's piece on online writing\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nAdditionally readers have limited time and attention. So, don't bury the lead. Don't make readers have to dig deep to uncover a point that can be stated succinctly. Show your readers your respect for their time and attention by making your point immediately clear. Then they can make an informed choice about whether they'd like to learn more. It's their time. Don't trick them with ambiguous or click-bait headlines. Let them invest it well by telling them upfront what it is you want to convince them of.\nOf course there are exceptions to the rule. For educational pieces, teaching a curriculum of topics, it may be appropriate to have multiple lessons. And if you're writing for literary value, then the core takeaway may not be the central reason for your writing. In the general case though, critical for the vast majority of blogs being written today, it is wise to stick to a single thesis. State it clearly and defend it well.\nIf you've learned just one thing from this article, it's that the best articles should leave you with just one thing to learn.\n","date":1578960000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578960000,"objectID":"afc7d52e8d205bca0cbb24b7c6e21b27","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-01-14-say-one-thing-well/","publishdate":"2020-01-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2020-01-14-say-one-thing-well/","section":"snippets","summary":"When writing a blog post, have a single clear message and convey it convincingly.","tags":null,"title":"Say One Thing Well","type":"snippets"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Background: Writing is Hard Sometimes I find writing feels easy \u0026ndash; e.g. when writing for no audience, when writing something you've already thought extensively about, when telling a story in a logical order that you're deeply familiar with. Other times, I find writing very difficult.\nWhen I'm writing a paper, I am writing explicitly for an audience, the story is not always clear immediately, and the material is something I'm becoming familiar with over time, not something about which I'm already deeply familiar. So, I find paper writing hard.\nI have an idea that I think will help me write more effectively. It's a software tool that structures the time you spend writing. I'll describe the tool, but I don't anticipate building it. Perhaps we can come up with a low-resource version of this idea, e.g. with paper and pencil, that I can try even without building this tool.\nThe Writing System The tool presents you with a prompt, a textbox, and a timer.\nThe initial prompt is \u0026ldquo;What do you want to write about?\u0026quot;, and the initial timer is for 5 minutes. Subsequent prompts will be determined from what you've entered in the past.\nIn the textbox, you are encouraged to respond to the prompt.\nAs part of your response, you can issue some commands / keywords. If you start a line with ! or ?, then that line will get used as a future prompt. You can specify the relative importance of a future prompt by including a priority. This will determine the order in which you are presented with the prompts. E.g. !0 is highest priority, and so such a line will become the next prompt you receive, unless there are other priority 0 prompts already queued up.\n! \u0026lt;topic\u0026gt; is short for \u0026ldquo;\u0026lt;topic\u0026gt; is a topic I want to write about later\u0026rdquo; ? \u0026lt;question\u0026gt; is short for \u0026ldquo;\u0026lt;question\u0026gt; is a question I want to answer later\u0026rdquo;\nThere should also be a way to indicate \u0026ldquo;\u0026lt;topic\u0026gt; is a topic I'll need to do more research on\u0026rdquo;, and then for one of the prompts to be about spending time researching a topic, rather than writing about it. Then the next prompt may be to write about what you just learned in the research section.\nOther available commands include:\n :pause to stop the timer :unpause to start the timer again :extend to add additional time to the timer :next to skip to the next prompt  The system is easily extensible, so a writer with a programming background can easily add new commands, or modify the logic that determines when prompts are shown and when breaks are taken. A programming-proficient writer will also have programmatic access to everything they write, as well as the corresponding prompts and metadata.\nOnce the timer reaches 0, a short break is initiated, and then the next prompt is revealed.\nThe idea is to move quickly, and get all your thoughts onto the page, without getting bogged down in a DFS traversal of information about a single line of the overall text.\nAdditional details Every keystroke is logged, so if you write something, and then switch to a new version of it, you will still be able to see the original version. No need to worry about pasting in a password though, since the keylogging data is readily accessible in a plaintext format and you can edit it directly e.g. if anything sensitive does leak in.\nThis system has a decent amount of overlap with the shh shell project that I've already built, and perhaps a version of this new idea could be easily added to the shh shell. Alternatively, the shh-shell could be forked to build this new system.\nCalendar integration would be cool, so that it times your prompts nicely if you have a meeting coming up so you get to a good break point in time for your meeting.\nImplementation Thoughts I'd like to build this onto an existing text editor, rather than writing my own. E.g. using Google Docs would be good. However, the disadvantage of this is that it makes the keystroke logging feature more difficult. Fortunately, Google Docs does have good history tracking. Google Docs also provides good programmatic access. So, an agent running in the background while you write could be taking periodic snapshots too. Such an agent could also be extracting the commands and prompts you write.\nHowever, it wouldn't be able to execute the commands immediately, the way shh shell does. For some commands this may be a real disadvantage.\nI also like the idea of the agent giving the prompts being Bieber Bot \u0026ndash; that is, being the same being as my personal digital assistant. I can picture it asking me \u0026ldquo;you've been writing continuously for over an hour; is it time for a break?\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;it looks like you stopped writing abruptly there, did you get distracted?\u0026quot;.\nInitial Experimentation I've been trying the idea out in a low-tech way (manually timing things, manually looking up what the next prompt should be).\nHere is the main issue I've seen so far in the first half hour of testing. When the time runs out for a prompt, I'm still in the middle of the prompt. I've usually started expounding on some idea relevant to the prompt, and there are actually several ideas remaining that I haven't even started exploring for the prompt yet. So what should have happened / what should I do next time? Maybe I could have done a higher level discussion of the prompt and made new future sub-prompts along the way. Or at the end of a section, I could have the system give me a bit of time to create sub-prompts of things I'd like to address in the section but didn't get to.\nI could see having a limited time to create new prompts be a good forcing function for coming up with structured high level thinking after a moderate amount of time of lower level writing. So in my next round of testing, I'll try this, and continue to iterate on the idea.\n","date":1578873600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578873600,"objectID":"b4fb9d74a171145aed97ecfca68f582f","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-01-13-writing-tool-idea/","publishdate":"2020-01-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2020-01-13-writing-tool-idea/","section":"snippets","summary":"A structured question-asking tool may be useful for writing effectively.","tags":null,"title":"Writing Assistant Tool Idea","type":"snippets"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Long ago (2013) I spent a summer interning at Khan Academy. Also long ago (2014) Harvest and I built a tool for creating educational videos online, in the browser (Teach Everyone; warning, bit rot ahead).\nToday, I want to see these two methodologies combined.\nI want it to become common practice that after you spend significant time learning something online, you make a quick-and-dirty video explaining what you just learned.\nThe Vision Imagine you've just completed a series of organic chemistry lessons on Khan Academy. The KA website pops up a modal recommending that you \u0026ldquo;Make a video teaching what you learned to help solidify your understanding of Organic Chemistry!\u0026quot;.\nYou click through to a browser based video creation tool \u0026ndash; a cross between Google Slides, Illustrator / Teach Everyone, and OBS / a video editor. In minutes, you're able to assemble a video teaching the material you've spent the last hours or days wrapping your head around.\nYou combine text, images, drawings, video, and audio to create your video. And when you're done, you have the option to save it privately, share it on YouTube or social media, or to make it visible to others studying the same subject.\nBenefits There are two main benefits from this approach.\n You get to learn by teaching.  Teaching is a super effective way to:\n Reinforce the material so that you remember it longer Help you notice gaps in your understanding and fill them in  So by preparing this little video after spending all that time learning, you'll be left with a better and longer lasting understanding of the material.\nOthers can learn from you  Often times the best teachers are those who remember what it's like not to understand. Since you've just gone through the process of learning the material, you know exactly which parts were difficult to grasp and what it took for you to grasp them. So your video may end up helping others more than the KA videos in some cases!\nVideo Creation Tool This post isn't a design doc, but I will briefly sketch out what I imagine for the video creation tool.\nThe main interface is a video preview above a timeline, similar to what you would see in Davinci Resolve or any professional video editing tool. You additionally have the option to create clips.\nYou can create clips from text, images, KA-style drawings, audio, or video. Importantly, you can record audio and video clips, or create a KA-style drawing, directly in your browser.\nOnce you've created some clips, you can position them both in time (on the timeline), and in space (on the video preview).\nI intend to write more about the details of this vision for video creation tool at a later point, but for now the most important thing about it is that it prioritizes being quick to use over being fully featured and professional, and that it can be used directly in the browser. This way it can be used by online learners as part of their online learning experience.\nAdditional Notes My main premise is that students, young and old, should have a light-weight way to create educational videos immediately after learning something online.\nI've framed this discussion around a hypothetical tool for students to use on Khan Academy, but it applies equally well to educational videos on YouTube and elsewhere. Teach Everyone was an early prototype showing that you can create Khan Academy style animated drawings (i.e. virtual writing on a blackboard) with accompanying audio directly in the browser. Since then, Teach Everyone has suffered some bit rot and unfortunately isn't operational today. However, I'm hopeful that some new project will step up, and provide an even better in-browser experience for educational video creation. And then beyond that, I'm hopeful that this tool becomes common place for students to use as part of their everyday online learning routine.\nIf you want to discuss these ideas, don't hesitate to get in touch: david810+learning-by-teaching@gmail.com.\n","date":1578528000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578528000,"objectID":"4c963c7056adfee11d2d0b7723f209be","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-01-09-learning-by-teaching/","publishdate":"2020-01-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/snippets/2020-01-09-learning-by-teaching/","section":"snippets","summary":"One of the best ways to learn is to teach.","tags":null,"title":"Learning by Teaching in Online Education","type":"snippets"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\u0026ldquo;Ordinary Least Squares\u0026rdquo; regression, or OLS for short, is a method for finding a best-fit line, given a set of data points.

I could put high quality posts on the main site, and a whole range of both good and bad posts in the snippets section. This way, assuming I do a good job, readers could come to expect that any post on the main website would be high quality. Curious people looking for additional content could come here to the snippets section if they wanted to, but more often posts here would either (1) almost never get read, or (2) be linked to directly, e.g. if they were relevent in some other context.\nI've been surprised and delighted by the effect that having this \u0026ldquo;No Audience\u0026rdquo; section of the website has had on my writing. Writing for no one is so much easier than writing for someone.\nOn a few occasions (and it's only been a few days since I started this section), I've started writing snippets intending for them to be brief thoughts meant for no one but myself. Then, after starting, it has felt natural to expand the post into something more substantial than I originally intended, e.g. answering questions that a hypothetical reader might have.\nOn one occasion I even decided to bump the post up in importance after getting started, placing it in the main section of the website rather than relegating it to the mostly hidden snippets section.\nTo anyone out there who does end up reading this, and there may very well be none of you: if you're having trouble getting started with writing, write for no audience.\n The Different Degrees of \u0026ldquo;No Audience\u0026rdquo; I actually write for No Audience in two different contexts.\n(1) The snippets section of my website\n(2) Using shh-shell at night\nThe snippets section of my website is public, but with no built-in broadcasting. People can read it if they choose to, but I'm not putting it in people's faces (by default; I will if it's appropriate in context). Contrast this with the writing I do with the shh-shell. This is more personal writing that I do half-asleep as I drift off at night, and so I don't make it public; I expect almost no one will ever read it. This writing, I suppose is for No Audience to an even more extreme degree. I recommend both practices: public writing for no audience, and private writing for no audience.\nSocial Media Doesn't Cut It Now that I've discovered this practice and am quite fond of it, I think it could be a promising addition to social media.\nNo social media platform, to my knowledge, has given people a place to write public posts with an option to publish but not share them. The absense of such a feature makes sense; social media platforms need you to share for them to succeed, so how would giving you a space to publish-but-not-share help them? The answer lies in the psychology of the many social-media lurkers. There is a significant market segment of people who perhaps consume, but do not post, on social media. An option to publish-but-not-broadcast might help to convert some of that segment into sharers.\nAs a social media consumer, but infrequent producer, I can tell you I am hesitant even to Like something on Twitter, because I know Twitter often treats Likes like Retweets, and will put the content I hearted in front of my followers with my name attached, and that's not something I want.\nIf a feature for publishing-without-sharing were added to Facebook or Twitter, perhaps others would have an experience like mine over the last few days. Having the option to publish-but-not-share has significantly reduced the barrier to start writing for me. Then, once I've started writing, I've often changed my mind and decided I want to share what I've written after all.\nIf other social-media lurkers are like me, a feature enabling this behavior could help \u0026ldquo;break the ice\u0026rdquo; so to speak, and could make social media platforms more relevant to them.\nNext Steps I'm going to continue building this snippets section for myself, with the default behavior being no-broadcasting as I add snippets. For snippets I'm fond of, I may choose to broadcast (e.g. by posting about the post on social media). Contrast this with the main posts section of my website; for new posts there, I will generally always broadcast the post, at least a little bit.\nIf you'd like to receive such broadcasts, e.g. when I write a post that I'm particularly keen on sharing, please consider subscribing:\n#mc_embed_signup{ background:#fff; clear:left; font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; }  Email Address           (function($) {window.fnames = new Array(); window.ftypes = new Array();fnames[0]='EMAIL';ftypes[0]='email';fnames[1]='FNAME';ftypes[1]='text';fnames[2]='LNAME';ftypes[2]='text';fnames[3]='ADDRESS';ftypes[3]='address';fnames[4]='PHONE';ftypes[4]='phone';fnames[5]='BIRTHDAY';ftypes[5]='birthday';}(jQuery));var $mcj = jQuery.noConflict(true); Ironically, you are also welcome to follow the snippets section with RSS.

Really exciting! This is rich data, from which I think I'll be able to learn a lot and hopefully combat unwanted distractions.\nFirst let me describe what information is available, and how you can access it. Then, let's discuss what you can do with this data. As I've written about previously [1] [2], I already have a chat bot system in place, which will be able to take advantage of this data to e.g. help me stay focused.\nAccessing Your Browser History Thank you to GitHub user dropmeaword for compiling this gist explaining how to access your browser history via sqlite3. The gist covers Safari, Chrome, and Firefox. In this post, I'll just focus on Chrome on OSX, since that's my primary mode of browsing.\nMy Chrome browsing history is located at ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History. Since I use multiple profiles in Chrome, each profile gets its own browsing history, e.g. located at ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Profile 1/History.\nEach browsing history is stored as a sqlite3 database. Before analyzing the data, I recommend making a copy of it (cp ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History my-history); this way your history database (a) wont be locked by Chrome while you're trying to access it, and (b) wont change while you're looking at it, which could cause confusion and inconsistencies in your results.\nThis means you can browse it interactively using the sqlite3 REPL by running sqlite3 PATH_TO_DATABASE.\nThere are also libraries available for accessing sqlite3 databases in just about every language. For Python, there's the sqlite3 library. Go has go-sqlite3. JavaScript has this sqlite3 module. However you most like scripting, you'll have a familiar way of accessing the data.\nThe Available Data Running sqlite3 macro .tables, we see the following tables are available.\n          downloads meta urls   downloads_slices segment_usage visit_source   downloads_url_chains segments visits   keyword_search_terms typed_url_sync_metadata     We'll be most interested in the urls and visits tables.\nThe urls table has these columns (found with .schema urls):\n   Column Type Description     id Integer Id The id of the URL in the database.   url Text The URL of the website.   title Text The title of website.   visit_count Integer The number of times you've visited the URL.   typed_count Integer The number of times you've visited the URL by typing in the address (as opposed to by following a link.)   last_visit_time Integer (microseconds since the epoch) The time of the most recent to the URL.   hidden Boolean I'm not sure what this is about.    And the visits table has these columns (obtained via .schema visits):\n   Column Type Description     id Integer Id The id of the visit in the database.   url Integer Id The id of the url in the urls table.   visit_time Integer (milliseconds since the epoch) The time of the visit.   from_visit Integer Id The id of the visit that lead you to this one.   transition Bit vector Represents the transition type (how you got to the URL)   segment_id Integer Id The id of the segment in the database. I'm not quite sure what a segment is, but there is a segments table you can look at.   visit_duration Integer (microseconds) The amount of time spent at the website, or 0 if not available.   incremented_omnibox_typed_score Boolean I do not know what this is about.    As you can see, we can access every visit to every website that we've made since the last time we cleared our browsing history. We can see what website we visited (visits.url), when we visited it (visits.visit_time), how many times we've visited it (urls.visit_count), and how long each visit was for (visits.visit_duration).\nWe can even use visits.from_visit to figure out what website linked us to each url, if that interests us.\nWhat Can We Deduce? We can (1) perform a historical analysis on the data, as well as (2) do real-time monitoring of the data.\nHere I brainstorm some of the historical trends we will be able to uncover:\n Most frequently visited websites Websites where we spend the majority of our time Websites that frequently lead to known-distractor websites (e.g. Reddit, Hacker News, Twitter, YouTube) We can do an analysis by time of day (or day of week), to figure out what sites occupy my time late at night vs during daylight hours.  These are somewhat interesting, but what I'm particularly excited for is the ongoing analysis that Bieber Bot can provide by accessing the data.\nHere is a brainstorm of the more real-time actionable insights we might extract from this data.\n Bieber Bot could ping me if it looks like I'm spending too much time on a distraction website. He could try to detect if I went to a website with a particular purpose, but ended up getting distracted and not completing the purpose I set out to do.  For example, if I'm on a productive website and then switch to a distraction website for more than a few minutes, particularly during work hours, Bieber Bot might message asking if I got distracted. Think you could do that for me Bieber Bot?\n I could signal that I want to view a website later by opening it and immediately closing it again. Perhaps we could detect if I'm researching a particular topic, and then Bieber Bot could try to help me with my research.  Related Idea In order to reduce distractions, I'd like to be able to switch my browsing mode from \u0026ldquo;clicking opens links\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;clicking saves a link for later\u0026rdquo;. When in this new mode, whenever I click a link it wouldn't open that link; instead, it would save the link to a list of deferred links. Then I would be able to view my \u0026ldquo;saved for later\u0026rdquo; links when I have time that I've explicitly set aside, rather than during the time that I would rather be doing something more productive.\nNext Steps So far I've done a little bit of manual exploration of my browsing history data. I've set up a little Python script to be able to access the data programmatically.\nNext, I'll do more manual analysis, and then I'll see if I'm able to give Bieber Bot the real-time access to the data that I described above. I'm particularly excited to see if I can get the \u0026ldquo;looks like you've gotten distracted\u0026rdquo; messages set up with Bieber Bot. As a bonus, since Bieber Bot can message other people too, this system could help me leverage social accountability to stay on task.\nWant to see where this project leads?

This is my plan.","tags":null,"title":"Planning to Analyze My Browsing History","type":"snippets"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"As many of my friends know, I keep track of much of my life in spreadsheets. There are several pieces to this system, but fortunately it's the kind of system that you can adopt (and discard) incrementally. So, rather than explaining the whole thing in one go, I will explain one core piece in this post.\nIn this post, I will detail how I use a spreadsheet as a daily activity log.\nMy spreadsheet lets me keep a record of all the things I've done. It then also rolls up this data in interesting ways that help me with reflecting on and planning my life. Finally, it interacts with a bot system I've written for myself to help me keep my life on track.\nI will answer all of the following questions in this post:\n What's the organizational system? What are the main benefits of this system? Why is this system easy to adopt? Why is this system easy to keep doing for months on end, without forgetting? How does this system help me with planning my life?  The System I have a single spreadsheet with columns Evening, Morning, Keywords, Weekday, Date, People, Notes. In this sheet, I have a single row per day.\nThe essense of the system is to jot down (1) what I do, and optionally (2) who I engage with each day.\nI don't update the spreadsheet every day, usually just once a week or so I'll fill in the activity from all of the missing days.\nThis system serves several purposes, the main one being a journal of sorts so I can see a historical log of my activities. As you'll see in the Planning and Notifications sections, it also helps me remember to regularly do all the activities I enjoy doing.\nI'll start by providing a brief description of each column in the spreadsheet. Then we'll get to discuss how I use the spreadsheet, and you'll see why they're each important to me. We'll then also dive into all the benefits I get from this spreadsheet and the infrastructure I've built up around it.\nColumn Descriptions    Column Type Description     Evening Text A single cell in which to put the main activity I did in the evening (e.g. after work) on that day.   Morning Optional, Text, infrequently used The main activity I did in the morning (e.g. before work) on that day.   Keywords Optional, comma separated Keywords describing the activities of that day.   Weekday Filled automatically The day of the week, e.g. Thursday   Date Filled automatically The date   People Names, comma separated A list of the people I engaged with on that day   Notes Optional, Text A bit like a diary, this is a place to jot down additional notes about the day.    Really all of the columns are optional, but the ones that are particularly optional are marked as such.\nUsage Now I'll describe the data entry process, and then all the ways I take advantage of this data.\nData Entry About once a week on average I'll go to the spreadsheet, and fill in all the activities I did since the last time I updated the sheet.\nFor each day, I try to capture just the main one to two outside-of-work activities that I engaged in. It's totally fine if I don't capture every little thing, and it's also fine if there are some days that I didn't do anything of note.\nI said above that I do this about once a week, but there's no strong rhythm to it; sometimes I do it every day for multiple consecutive days, and sometimes I'll go multiple weeks between updating the sheet.\nI've been using this system reliably since mid-2018, and it's served me well. The notifications that we'll get to shortly, combined with the simplicity of the method (just one cell to fill in per day), have allowed me to keep using this system without being disrupted by travel or high-workload parts of life.\nPlanning I have a second sheet that is updated automatically using data from the sheet I've been describing so far. This sheet has one row per activity that I enjoy engaging in.\nThe most important columns in this sheet are:\n   Column Type Description     Category Text The category of the activity (e.g. Athletic).   Activity Text An activity that I enjoy engaging in. (e.g. Skiing)   Last Date Filled automatically The most recent date on which I engaged in the activity.    The Last Date column is filled automatically using the data from the main sheet. The Google Sheets formula that fills in this column is a query a bit like this one:\n=IFERROR(QUERY(scheduled, \u0026quot;select E where A contains '\u0026quot; \u0026amp; C2 \u0026amp; \u0026quot;' OR B contains '\u0026quot; \u0026amp; C2 \u0026amp; \u0026quot;' OR C contains '\u0026quot; \u0026amp; C2 \u0026amp; \u0026quot;' order by E desc limit 1 label E ''\u0026quot; ))   C2 refers to the Activity from the current sheet A is the Evening column from the Data Entry sheet B is the Morning column from the Data Entry sheet C is the Keywords column from the Data Entry sheet E is the Date from the Data Entry sheet  This lets me quickly see, for each activity that I enjoy, how recently I've done that activity. For example, I see that I haven't gone camping since 2019-07-05, I haven't played tennis since 2018-07-31, and I haven't gone swimming since 2019-10-07. Really overdue for some tennis!\nMy spreadsheet also rolls up this data further, by category. I can quickly see how recently I've done any activity in a given category.\nThe categories I use are: \u0026ldquo;Athletic\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Civic Something Or Other\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Day Trips\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Educational\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Entertainment\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Family\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Financial\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Food\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Music + Arts\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Outdoorsy\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Personal Projects\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Puzzles\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Social\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Social Games\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;Well being\u0026rdquo;.\nHere you can see how recently I've done something in each of the categories.\n   As you can see, I'm doing a pretty good job of doing most of the categories of activities. When I go to make plans next, I'll most likely schedule activities from the bottom categories. For example, I may do a financial review, schedule a board game night, and plan to attend a City Council meeting.\nNotifications I've also given Bieber Bot (my digital personal assistant and robot friend) access to this data, and he helps me make better use of it.\nIf it's been too long since I've scheduled an activity in any particular category, Bieber Bot will message me on FB Messenger reminding me to schedule something in that category.\n   Similarly BieberBot will remind me each day of any upcoming activities planned for that day. And if I don't have any activity planned for a particular day, BieberBot may take the liberty of suggesting an activity.\n   Finally BieberBot will also remind me if I haven't been entering activities into the spreadsheet in a while, so I don't fall too far behind on the logging system.\nSetting up these notifcations is a bit outside the scope of this post, but if it interests you how BieberBot works, you can subscribe for future posts here:\n#mc_embed_signup{ background:#fff; clear:left; font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; }  Email Address           (function($) {window.fnames = new Array(); window.ftypes = new Array();fnames[0]='EMAIL';ftypes[0]='email';fnames[1]='FNAME';ftypes[1]='text';fnames[2]='LNAME';ftypes[2]='text';fnames[3]='ADDRESS';ftypes[3]='address';fnames[4]='PHONE';ftypes[4]='phone';fnames[5]='BIRTHDAY';ftypes[5]='birthday';}(jQuery));var $mcj = jQuery.noConflict(true); You can also learn a bit more about BieberBot here, but there's so much more to be written.\nArchiving Old Events To keep things clean, my spreadsheet also uses Google Apps Script to archive old events. You can see the code I use for the auto-archiving here.\nGetting Started If this system sounds appealing to you, it's very simple to get started.\nSimply create a new Google sheet with the columns you'd like to track. I use the following:\n   Evening Morning Keywords Weekday Date People Notes    But for just getting started you might be satisfied with something simpler, say just these three columns:\n   Activity Weekday Date    You can use the formula =TEXT(WEEKDAY(E3), \u0026quot;dddd\u0026quot;) to autopopulate the Weekday column, where E3 represents the date (tip: you can use cmd-; to enter today's date into a cell).\nI also create a second sheet called Archive with the same columns as the main sheet, and use the auto-archiving feature mentioned earlier to prevent the main sheet from getting cluttered.\nNext create the analysis sheet with the columns:\n   Category Activity Last Date    The first two columns you can fill in with whatever categories and activities you like, and you can add new categories and activities at any time. No need to fill this in too much until you start to see how you're using the main sheet.\nTo autofill the Last Date column, the full formula I use is:\n=MAX( IFERROR(QUERY(scheduled, \u0026quot;select E where A contains '\u0026quot; \u0026amp; C2 \u0026amp; \u0026quot;' OR B contains '\u0026quot; \u0026amp; C2 \u0026amp; \u0026quot;' or C contains '\u0026quot; \u0026amp; C2 \u0026amp; \u0026quot;' order by E desc limit 1 label E ''\u0026quot; )), IFERROR(QUERY(archive, \u0026quot;select E where A contains '\u0026quot; \u0026amp; C2 \u0026amp; \u0026quot;' OR B contains '\u0026quot; \u0026amp; C2 \u0026amp; \u0026quot;' or C contains '\u0026quot; \u0026amp; C2 \u0026amp; \u0026quot;' order by E desc limit 1 label E ''\u0026quot; )) )  This searches both the main sheet (scheduled) and the archive sheet for the most recent occurrence of each activity (C2). For this to work, the rows in the archive and main sheet need to be in reverse chronological order.\nFinally, to get the roll-up by category, I use the following Google Sheets formula:\n=QUERY(A:E, \u0026quot;select B, max(D), count(B) where B\u0026lt;\u0026gt;'' group by B order by max(D) desc label max(D) 'Last date', count(B) 'Count' \u0026quot;, -1)  Though I would like to, I won't go into how to set up the notifications in this post. For now, that's just between me and BieberBot.\nConclusion As a quick recap of my system: (1) I manually enter the activity(s) I do each day; (2) the spreadsheet automatically figures out how recently I did each category of activity; (3) bonus: BieberBot uses this data to help me keep my life on track.\nI've been using this system for about 18 months now, and I've been quite happy with the insight it provides and how helpful it is for planning.\nStill, there are many pieces of my system left undiscussed: tracking financial transactions, taking notes on academic papers, staying in touch with friends and colleagues, dealing with social media, and more! I'd love to tell you about the rest, so stay tuned. And don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to discuss anything you read. I hope you find this useful, and do let me know if you start using a spreadsheet to track your own life or have a system of your own.\n","date":1577577600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577577600,"objectID":"fbc695f7354c14d0b7602af871dee2e8","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/post/2019-12-29-track-your-life-in-a-spreadsheet/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-12-29-track-your-life-in-a-spreadsheet/","section":"post","summary":"I use a daily activity log to track my habits and plan future activities.","tags":null,"title":"Keeping Track of My Life in a Spreadsheet","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Today I learned the word \u0026ldquo;feedingstuffs\u0026rdquo;.\nfeedingstuff (countable and uncountable, plural feedingstuffs) Any foodstuff used to feed livestock.

I'd really like something that's lower barrier to do, and with a lower quality bar, so that I can do this more often. The natural alternative with these properties is academic Twitter. However, I want to avoid the addictive nature of Twitter. I also want to write more than 280 characters at a time, and I don't want to put every little thing I write in front of people's faces with equal importance.

That is, a pair of nodes may be connected by an edge in the first graph if and only if the corresponding pair of nodes in the second graph is also connected by an edge in the same way. An example of two isomorphic graphs is shown here.\nFigure: Graph 1 and Graph 2 are isomorphic. The correspondance between nodes is illustrated by the node colors and numbers.\nIn general, determining whether two graphs are isomorphic when the correspondance is not provided is a challenging problem; precisely how hard this problem is remains an open question in computer science. It isn't known whether there is a polynomial time algorithm for determining whether graphs are isomorphic, and it also isn't known whether the problem is $\\text{NP-complete}$. The graph isomorphism problem may even be an example of an $\\text{NP-intermediate}$ problem, but this would only be possible if $\\text{P} \\ne \\text{NP}$.\nThe Weisfeiler-Lehman Isomorphism Test Here is the algorithm for the Weisfeiler-Lehman Isomorphism Test. It produces for each graph a canonical form. If the canonical forms of two graphs are not equivalent, then the graphs are definitively not isomorphic. However, it is possible for two non-isomorphic graphs to share a canonical form, so this test alone cannot provide conclusive evidence that two graphs are isomorphic.\nThe Algorithm:\n For iteration $i$ of the algorithm we will be assigning to each node a tuple $L_{i,n}$ containing the node's old compressed label and a multiset of the node's neighbors\u0026rsquo; compressed labels. A multiset is a set (a collection of elements where order is not important) where elements may appear multiple times. At each iteration we will additionally be assigning to each node $n$ a new \u0026ldquo;compressed\u0026rdquo; label $C_{i,n}$ for that node's set of labels. Any two nodes with the same $L_{i,n}$ will get the same compressed label.   To begin, we initialize $C_{0,n} = 1$ for all nodes $n$. At iteration $i$ of the algorithm (beginning with $i=1$), for each node $n$, we set $L_{i,n}$ to be a tuple containing the node's old label $C_{i-1,n}$ and the multiset of compressed node labels $C_{i-1,m}$ from all nodes $m$ neighboring $n$ from the previous iteration $(i-1)$. We then complete iteration $i$ by setting $C_{i,n}$ to be a new \u0026ldquo;compressed\u0026rdquo; label, such as a hash of $L_{i,n}$. Any two nodes with the same labels $L_{i,n}$ must get the same compressed label $C_{i,n}$. Partition the nodes in the graph by their compressed label. Repeat 2 + 3 for up to $N$ (the number of nodes) iterations, or until there is no change in the partition of nodes by compressed label from one iteration to the next.  When using this method to determine graph isomorphism, it may be applied in parallel to the two graphs. The algorithm may be terminated early after iteration $i$ if the sizes of partitions of nodes partitioned by compressed labels diverges between the two graphs; if this is the case, the graphs are not isomorphic.\nExample of the Weisfeiler-Lehman Isomorphism Test We demonstrate here the Weisfeiler-Lehman isomorphism test using the example graphs from above. The graphs are shown again here for completeness.\nFigure: Graph 1 and Graph 2 are isomorphic. We will apply the Weisfeiler-Lehman isomorphism test to these graphs as a means of illustrating the test.\nTo initialize the algorithm (Step 1), we set $C_{0,n} = 1$ for all nodes $n$.\nFor iteration 1, Step 2, we compute $L_{1,n}$. The first part of a node's $L$ is the node's old compressed label; the second part of a node's $L$ is the multiset of the neighboring nodes\u0026rsquo; compressed labels.\nFor iteration 1, Step 3, we introduce \u0026ldquo;compressed\u0026rdquo; labels $C_{1,n}$ for the nodes:\nWe now begin iteration 2. In iteration 2, Step 2, we compute $L_{2,n}$:\nIn iteration 2, Step 3, we compute $C_{2,n}$:\nIn iteration 3, Step 2, we compute $L_{3,n}$:\nIn iteration 3, Step 3, we compute $C_{3,n}$:\nSince the partition of nodes by compressed label has not changed from $C_{2,n}$ to $C_{3,n}$, we may terminate the algorithm here.\nConcretely, the partition of nodes by compressed label may be represented as the number of nodes with each compressed label. That is: \u0026ldquo;2 7s, 1 8, and 2 9s\u0026rdquo;. This is the canonical form of our graph. Since both Graph 1 and Graph 2 have this same canonical form, we cannot rule out the possibility that they are isomorphic (they are in fact isomorphic, but the algorithm doesn't allow us to conclude this definitively.)\nImplementation Considerations One detail omitted is that the algorithm requires canonical forms of the multisets for comparison. Placing the elements of the multiset in sorted order provides one way of doing this.\nAdditionally, for the representation of the graph that the algorithm emits to be deterministic, we need to establish a convention for creating compressed labels. One possible convention is to use increasing integers starting from 1, and to assign compressed labels to nodes in lexicographical order of their non-compressed labels. Another possible convention is to use the hash of the multiset to create the compressed label.\nWhen comparing the partition of the nodes by compressed label from one iteration to the next to see whether to proceed to another iteration, it is sufficient to compare which nodes are in each partition. If the partitions change, we proceed to the next iteration. If no partition changes, the algorithm can terminate early. When comparing the partitions of the nodes across graphs to see if graphs are isomorphic, we use the canonical form as described above in the algorithm.\nFinding the Correspondance Between Isomorphic Graphs The core idea of the Weisfeiler-Lehman isomorphism test is to find for each node in each graph a signature based on the neighborhood around the node. These signatures can then be used to find the correspondance between nodes in the two graphs, which can be used to check for isomorphism.\nIn the algorithm descibed above, the \u0026ldquo;compressed labels\u0026rdquo; serve as the signatures. Since multiple nodes may have the same compressed label, there are multiple possible correspondances suggested by a Weisfeiler-Lehman labeling. The Weisfeiler-Lehman isomorphism test itself does not provide a way of narrowing down the possible correspondances further.\nThe Disappearance of Boris Weisfeiler Boris Weisfeiler \u0026ndash; one of the two mathematicians responsible for the Weisfeiler-Lehman isomorphism test \u0026ndash; was a professor at Penn State University until he disappeared mysteriously in Chile in 1985. His disappearance in the 80s is unsettling, and I would encourage you to visit boris.weisfeiler.com to learn more about the search for Weisfeiler and the ongoing (2018) judicial proceedings surrounding his disappearance.\nSteven List produced an award winning short film called The Colony based on the disappearance of Boris Weisfeiler, available on Vimeo here.\nAfter a brief internet search, I have been unable to find any information about Weisfeiler's colleague and coauthor A. Lehman, not even a first name.\nNP-Intermediate Problems As mentioned in the introduction, it is not known whether the graph isomorphism problem is in $\\text{P}$ or $\\text{NP-complete}$. In fact, it is not even known whether graph isomorphism falls in either of these categories, or whether this problem is $\\text{NP-intermediate}$. The problem of factoring integers is another problem like this, where it is unknown whether the problem is in $\\text{P}$, $\\text{NP-complete}$, or is $\\text{NP-intermediate}$. Bear in mind that $\\text{NP-intermediate}$ problems can only exist if $\\text{P} \\ne \\text{NP}$. So if anyone were to show conclusively that factoring or graph isomorphism were $\\text{NP-intermediate}$ they would also have shown $\\text{P} \\ne \\text{NP}$ and won the Clay Institute P vs NP Millenium Problem\u0026lsquo;s million dollar prize.\nApplications of Graph Isomorphisms Now that you're familiar with the Weisfeiler-Lehman test for graph isomorphisms, what is the graph isomorphism problem good for?\nThere are applications of the graph isomorphism problem in, for example, computational chemistry and in circuit design.\nIn chemistry, it is common to represent a molecule as a graph, with the atoms in the molecule being the nodes of the graph and the bonds between molecules being the edges. Here, the graph isomorphism problem can be used to determine if two chemical structures are in fact the same structure. This is important for drug discovery, where scientists are working to create molecular structures that will be useful in order to fight diseases.\nA circuit is commonly represented as a graph as well. The components in the circuit form the nodes of the graph, and the connections between components form the edges. The graph isomorphism problem is useful here for determining whether two circuits that are laid out different are in fact identical.\nReferences Weisfeiler and Lehman first proposed this method in their paper A reduction of a graph to a canonical form and an algebra arising during this reduction in 1968. An English translation of this paper, originally published in Russian, is available here.\nMore recently the method is also described succinctly in Weisfeiler-Lehman Graph Kernels (Shervashidze 2011).\nNow go forth and detect graph isomorphisms!\n","date":1557446400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557446400,"objectID":"06ac8bc3dc057b88709f32ee7e138666","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/post/2019-05-10-weisfeiler-lehman-isomorphism-test/","publishdate":"2019-05-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-05-10-weisfeiler-lehman-isomorphism-test/","section":"post","summary":"Explains the Weisfeiler-Lehman Graph Isomorphism Test","tags":[],"title":"The Weisfeiler-Lehman Isomorphism Test","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1540512000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540512000,"objectID":"3b7b100d031b3b150a269a1faa07444a","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/projects/","publishdate":"2018-10-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/","section":"","summary":"An overview of projects","tags":null,"title":"Projects","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["David Bieber"],"categories":null,"content":"Google Apps Script is endlessly useful; in this post you will learn how to write a mail merge with Google Apps Script. It's less than 30 lines of code! You can use this technique to send personalized emails individually to many recipients. In the second part of this post, you will learn how to schedule these emails to send in the future.\nPart 1: Writing a Mail Merge A mail merge is a program that sends an email to many recipients, automatically filling in the contents of the email according to a template. It's like a form letter. Each recipient receives a personalized copy of the email.\nIn this section we use Google Apps Script to create a mail merge that sends personalized \u0026ldquo;Happy Birthday\u0026rdquo; messages to a group of our friends. This will involve writing a template email, creating a spreadsheet, and writing a small amount of JavaScript code. With practice, you can perform tasks like this in well under an hour.\nFirst, we draft the email in Gmail. We'll use angle brackets for the parts of the message we want to replace with data from our spreadsheet.\nSubject: Happiest Birthday! Body: Dear \u0026lt;name\u0026gt;, Happy birthday! I think you, \u0026lt;name\u0026gt;, personally are awesome. You may be getting older, but you're still the coolest person I know. What are you now, \u0026lt;age\u0026gt;? Wow. Party on! David  Next, we create a Google Spreadsheet (sheets.google.com) with three columns like this:\nName Email Age ... ... ...  (To add yourself to my spreadsheet and actually receive a happy birthday email on your alleged birthday, just fill out this form.)\nInside your spreadsheet, choose Tools \u0026gt; Script Editor. This creates a new Apps Script associated with your spreadsheet.\nNow it's time to write some JavaScript. We're going to write a function to perform the mail merge. We'll call it performMailMerge and it won't have any parameters, e.g.:\nfunction performMailMerge() {}  It will use the built in SpreadsheetApp library to access the spreadsheet, the SpreadsheetDB library to perform basic data lookup operations on the spreadsheet, and the built in GmailApp library to look up drafts and send emails.\nSpreadsheetDB is a small library (a collection of useful functions) that allows us to quickly process rows in a spreadsheet, referencing columns by their header names. Choose one of the two options below for using SpreadsheetDB.\n  To use the library SpreadsheetDB, choose Resources \u0026gt; Libraries \u0026gt; Add a library and enter 193p7IxBukPVkoxwMH8UDcdkYJiNCDWSylMA_htgliEPxjjqixhzKt_2g. This is the ID of the SpreadsheetDB library. Select the latest version from the version dropdown menu. It should say \u0026ldquo;SpreadsheetDB\u0026rdquo; if you've done it right. This will allow you to use functions from the SpreadsheetDB library in your project.\n  To use SpreadsheetDB from source, create a new file in your project and name it spreadsheet.gs (the name is not important). Copy and paste in the source of SpreadsheetDB from the Gist here. If you choose to copy and paste the source into your project, then you must omit the prefix \u0026ldquo;SpreadsheetDB.\u0026rdquo; from your calls to the SpreadsheetDB functions in the following code. E.g. SpreadsheetDB.getColumnIndexesFromSheet would become just getColumnIndexesFromSheet.\n  Now that you're set up with SpreadsheetDB, I'll start by showing you the full program, then I'll explain what each line does.\nfunction performMailMerge() { var spreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet(); var sheet = spreadsheet.getSheetByName(\u0026quot;Sheet 1\u0026quot;); var indexes = SpreadsheetDB.getColumnIndexesFromSheet(sheet); var subject = \u0026quot;Happiest Birthday!\u0026quot;; var draftMessage = getDraftMessageBySubject(subject); var templateBody = draftMessage.getPlainBody(); SpreadsheetDB.forEachRow(sheet, function(row) { var name = row[indexes[\u0026quot;Name\u0026quot;]]; var email = row[indexes[\u0026quot;Email\u0026quot;]]; var age = row[indexes[\u0026quot;Age\u0026quot;]]; var body = templateBody.replace(/\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;/g, name).replace(/\u0026lt;age\u0026gt;/g, age); GmailApp.sendEmail(email, subject, body); }); } function getDraftMessageBySubject(subject) { var draftMessages = GmailApp.getDraftMessages(); for (var i = 0; i \u0026lt; draftMessages.length; i++) { var draftMessage = draftMessages[i]; if (draftMessage.getSubject() == subject) { return draftMessage; } } }  The documentation for the built in libraries is very good. You can find the documentation for SpreadsheetApp here and for GmailApp here.\nLet’s look at the pieces of this function individually:\nvar spreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet(); var sheet = spreadsheet.getSheetByName(\u0026quot;Sheet 1\u0026quot;);  This gives us a Sheet object that we can use to access and edit the main sheet of our spreadsheet.\nThe function call SpreadsheetDB.getColumnIndexesFromSheet(sheet) gives us back a mapping from column name to index. This is useful for accessing elements of a row by name later on. In our case, the result of getColumnIndexesFromSheet is the following mapping: {Name: 0, Email: 1, Age: 2}. This means that Name is column index 0, Email is column index 1, and Age is column index 2. We’re counting columns starting with zero. Perfect!\nThe call to getDraftMessageBySubject gets a draft from our Gmail drafts that we’ll use later to send the emails to our friends.\nWe use the SpreadsheetDB.forEachRow function to perform an action for each row in the spreadsheet except the headers. We pass a function with no name (an \u0026ldquo;anonymous function\u0026rdquo;) to SpreadsheetDB, and SpreadsheetDB will call that function once per non-header row of our spreadsheet.\nvar name = row[indexes[\u0026quot;Name\u0026quot;]]; var email = row[indexes[\u0026quot;Email\u0026quot;]]; var age = row[indexes[\u0026quot;Age\u0026quot;]];  The input to our anonymous function, row, is an array with the contents of the row currently being processed. From earlier, indexes[\u0026ldquo;Name\u0026rdquo;] is 0, indexes[\u0026ldquo;Email\u0026rdquo;] is 1, and indexes[\u0026ldquo;Age\u0026rdquo;] is 2. We can use this to get the name, email, and age of one of our friends from the spreadsheet.\nvar body = templateBody.replace(/\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;/g, name).replace(/\u0026lt;age\u0026gt;/g, age);  This is where the textual replacement actually happens. \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; is replaced with your friend's name. \u0026lt;age\u0026gt; is replaced with your friend's age. The \u0026lsquo;g\u0026rsquo; indicates that a \u0026ldquo;global\u0026rdquo; replacement should be performed, so every time the string \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; appears it will be replaced by the name of your friend from the spreadsheet. Without the \u0026lsquo;g\u0026rsquo;, only the first occurence of \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; would be replaced.\nGmailApp.sendMail(email, subject, body);  Last, this line sends the email!\nSince this is JavaScript, you can comment out lines by putting // at the start of the line. Everything occuring after // on the line will have no affect.\nI recommend commenting out the GmailApp.sendMail line before running this for the first time to so that you don't accidently email people incorrectly.\nAdd the line Logger.log(\u0026quot;To: \u0026quot; + email); Logger.log(\u0026quot;Subj: \u0026quot; + subject); Logger.log(\u0026quot;Body: \u0026quot; + body); in place of the GmailApp.sendMail line until you're convinced that the correct emails are going to be sent to the correct people. Only once you are sure it's working as intended, uncomment the GmailApp.sendMail line so it actually sends the emails.\nTo run the performMailMerge function, choose performMailMerge from the dropdown and click the run (right-arrow) button. To see your logs (the inputs to the Logger.log function calls), choose \u0026ldquo;View \u0026gt; Logs\u0026rdquo; or press ctrl-Enter or cmd-Enter.\nThat's it. When you run performMailMerge, the emails will be sent with the values from the spreadsheet substituted for the \u0026ldquo;\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;\u0026rdquo; placeholders in the draft. Once you've got the hang of this, let's add a few finishing touches before moving on to scheduling emails to be sent in the future.\nFinishing Touches Finishing touch 1: Adding a \u0026ldquo;Status\u0026rdquo; column to avoid emailing people twice.\nName Email Age Status ... ... ... ...  Let's add some finishing touches. Add to your spreadsheet a new column \u0026ldquo;Status\u0026rdquo;. When an email sends successfully, we'll set the status of the row to \u0026ldquo;Done\u0026rdquo;. If the status of a row is already \u0026ldquo;Done\u0026rdquo;, we'll skip that row. The updated code is shown here:\nfunction performMailMerge() { var spreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet(); var sheet = spreadsheet.getSheetByName(\u0026quot;Sheet 1\u0026quot;); var indexes = SpreadsheetDB.getColumnIndexesFromSheet(sheet); var subject = \u0026quot;Happiest Birthday!\u0026quot;; var draftMessage = getDraftMessageBySubject(subject); var templateBody = draftMessage.getPlainBody(); SpreadsheetDB.forEachRow(sheet, function(row) { var name = row[indexes[\u0026quot;Name\u0026quot;]]; var email = row[indexes[\u0026quot;Email\u0026quot;]]; var age = row[indexes[\u0026quot;Age\u0026quot;]]; var status = row[indexes[\u0026quot;Status\u0026quot;]]; if (status == \u0026quot;Done\u0026quot;) { return; } var body = templateBody.replace(/\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;/g, name).replace(/\u0026lt;age\u0026gt;/g, age); GmailApp.sendEmail(email, subject, body); row[indexes[\u0026quot;Status\u0026quot;]] = \u0026quot;Done\u0026quot;; return row; }); }  In order to make this change, we just check the value of row[indexes[\u0026quot;Status\u0026quot;]], and use a return statement to skip the row if the status is \u0026ldquo;Done\u0026rdquo;. In order to update the row, we modify the row array and return it and SpreadsheetDB takes care of updating the underlying spreadsheet.\nWith this change in place, we can now add new recipients to our spreadsheet even after having run the performMailMerge function, and if we run performMailMerge again we won't email anyone who has already received an email.\nFinishing touch 2: Adding a menu item that triggers our function.\nWhen we created our Apps Script, it was automatically associated with our spreadsheet. If we add a function named onOpen() to our Apps Script, it will automatically get run when the associated spreadsheet is opened. We can add a menu item to our spreadsheet by writing an onOpen function like this one:\nfunction onOpen() { SpreadsheetApp.getUi() .createMenu('Mail Merge') .addItem('Send Emails', 'performMailMerge') .addToUi(); }  Go ahead and refresh your spreadsheet. You should now see a menu called \u0026ldquo;Mail Merge\u0026rdquo; with a menu item \u0026ldquo;Send Emails\u0026rdquo;. Selecting \u0026ldquo;Send Emails\u0026rdquo; will cause your performMailMerge function to be run.\nPart 2: Scheduling Emails for the Future In Part 1 we wrote a mail merge function that emails our friends \u0026ldquo;personalized\u0026rdquo; Happy Birthday messages when we run performMailMerge. But why would we want to say happy birthday to all our friends at once? That's silly, it makes much more sense to send them a happy birthday message on their birthday. In this section, we'll modify our mail merge to send emails only on the birthday of the recipient.\nTo start, let's add a new \u0026ldquo;Birthday\u0026rdquo; column to our spreadsheet.\nName Email Age Birthday Status ... ... ... ... ...  We're going to use the moment.js library for working with dates. Create a new file (File \u0026gt; New \u0026gt; Script File) in your Apps Script project. Call it moment.gs, or anything else, and paste in the contents of the moment.js library. You can copy and paste moment.js from here. Note: Be sure to use the non-minified version of moment.js; if you try using the minified version you will likely have trouble pasting the library into your Apps Script project.\nNow that we have moment.js, we can get the date of our friends birthday like this: moment(row[indexes[\u0026quot;Birthday\u0026quot;]])\nWe can then write the function isTodaysDate like this. This will check that the month and day of the given date are today's month and day, irrespective of what year the given date has.\nfunction isTodaysDate(date) { var now = moment(); return now.isSame(date.year(now.year()), \u0026quot;day\u0026quot;); }  Putting it all together, we have this updated version of performMailMerge that will only send the email if the current date matches the birthday of the recipient.\nfunction isTodaysDate(date) { var now = moment(); return now.isSame(date.year(now.year()), \u0026quot;day\u0026quot;); } function performMailMerge() { var spreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet(); var sheet = spreadsheet.getSheetByName(\u0026quot;Sheet 1\u0026quot;); var indexes = SpreadsheetDB.getColumnIndexesFromSheet(sheet); var subject = \u0026quot;Happiest Birthday!\u0026quot;; var draftMessage = getDraftMessageBySubject(subject); var templateBody = draftMessage.getPlainBody(); SpreadsheetDB.forEachRow(sheet, function(row) { var name = row[indexes[\u0026quot;Name\u0026quot;]]; var email = row[indexes[\u0026quot;Email\u0026quot;]]; var age = row[indexes[\u0026quot;Age\u0026quot;]]; var status = row[indexes[\u0026quot;Status\u0026quot;]]; var birthday = moment(row[indexes[\u0026quot;Birthday\u0026quot;]]); if (status == \u0026quot;Done\u0026quot;) { return; } if (!isTodaysDate(birthday)) { return; } var body = templateBody.replace(/\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;/g, name).replace(/\u0026lt;age\u0026gt;/g, age); GmailApp.sendEmail(email, subject, body); row[indexes[\u0026quot;Status\u0026quot;]] = \u0026quot;Done\u0026quot;; return row; }); } function getDraftMessageBySubject(subject) { var draftMessages = GmailApp.getDraftMessages(); for (var i = 0; i \u0026lt; draftMessages.length; i++) { var draftMessage = draftMessages[i]; if (draftMessage.getSubject() == subject) { return draftMessage; } } }  Now the only step remaining is to make this performMailMerge function run every day. To do this, click the \u0026ldquo;Triggers\u0026rdquo; button in the toolbar (the clock icon). Create a new time-based trigger, and set it up so that it runs Daily (you get to choose when each day it will run). Configure it to run the performMailMerge each day at a time of your choice.\nViola!\nYou now have a mail merge that's running daily automatically, sending your friends Happy Birthday messages on their birthdays. Aren't you a good friend?\nWhile sending birthday emails automatically is somewhat impersonal, the techniques used here are broadly applicable. With Apps Script, you can send yourself reminders, monitor your Calendar events, track your finances, and more. It's a super useful and super friendly set of APIs, and this automated birthday emailer just scratches the surface of what Apps Script makes possible.\nWrap up You've now learned how to program a mail merge function that uses a spreadsheet as input. You can use a template to send multiple recipients personalized emails. You can schedule these emails to send in the future.\nYou now have a great power, and with it comes great responsibility. Don't use this for spam. Be kind and courteous to your fellow citizens of the internet. If you find this useful, do let me know what you use it for (I'm @Bieber on Twitter). I'm using Google Apps Script for a variety of things these days and I am always interested to hear how others are using the same tools.\n","date":1540080000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540080000,"objectID":"9880a12f6665d1a8498b79335a250447","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/post/2018-10-21-apps-script-mail-merge/","publishdate":"2018-10-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2018-10-21-apps-script-mail-merge/","section":"post","summary":"Use Google Apps Script to write a mail merge and schedule emails to send in the future.","tags":["Google Apps Script","Automation"],"title":"Writing a Mail Merge in Google Apps Script","type":"post"},{"authors":["David Bieber"],"categories":null,"content":"Originally posted on the Google Open Source Blog\nToday we are pleased to announce the open-sourcing of Python Fire. Python Fire generates command line interfaces (CLIs) from any Python code. Simply call the Fire function in any Python program to automatically turn that program into a CLI. The library is available from pypi via pip install fire, and the source is available on GitHub.\nPython Fire will automatically turn your code into a CLI without you needing to do any additional work. You don’t have to define arguments, set up help information, or write a main function that defines how your code is run. Instead, you simply call the Fire function from your main module, and Python Fire takes care of the rest. It uses inspection to turn whatever Python object you give it – whether it’s a class, an object, a dictionary, a function, or even a whole module – into a command line interface, complete with tab completion and documentation, and the CLI will stay up-to-date even as the code changes.\nTo illustrate this, let’s look at a simple example.\n#!/usr/bin/env python import fire class Example(object): def hello(self, name='world'): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;Says hello to the specified name.\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; return 'Hello {name}!'.format(name=name) def main(): fire.Fire(Example) if __name__ == '__main__': main()  When the Fire function is run, our command will be executed. Just by calling Fire, we can now use the Example class as if it were a command line utility.\n$ ./example.py hello Hello world! $ ./example.py hello David Hello David! $ ./example.py hello --name=Google Hello Google!  Of course, you can continue to use this module like an ordinary Python library, enabling you to use the exact same code both from Bash and Python. If you’re writing a Python library, then you no longer need to update your main method or client when experimenting with it; instead you can simply run the piece of your library that you’re experimenting with from the command line. Even as the library changes, the command line tool stays up to date.\nAt Google, engineers use Python Fire to generate command line tools from Python libraries. We have an image manipulation tool built by using Fire with the Python Imaging Library, PIL. In Google Brain, we use an experiment management tool built with Fire, allowing us to manage experiments equally well from Python or from Bash.\nEvery Fire CLI comes with an interactive mode. Run the CLI with the --interactive flag to launch an IPython REPL with the result of your command, as well as other useful variables already defined and ready to use. Be sure to check out Python Fire’s documentation for more on this and the other useful features Fire provides.\nBetween Python Fire’s simplicity, generality, and power, we hope you find it a useful library for your own projects.\n","date":1488758400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488758400,"objectID":"17e0a621b829262a0a17d56ec505dbdd","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/post/2017-03-06-introducing-python-fire/","publishdate":"2017-03-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2017-03-06-introducing-python-fire/","section":"post","summary":"Python Fire automatically generates command line interfaces from any Python objects.","tags":["Python Fire"],"title":"Introducing Python Fire","type":"post"},{"authors":["David Bieber"],"categories":null,"content":"This is my translation of P.D.

Now I'm able to drive a headless version of Firefox with Selenium using Python. This lets me do things like have my Scrabble Bot play Words with Friends autonomously on Facebook.\nWhat am I going to show you how to do?\nI'm going to explain how you can install Firefox and Selenium on a virtual machine in the cloud. I'm going to show this using a Debian instance on Google Compute Engine, but you could also do this using a virtual machine from Amazon EC2.\nBefore continuing you should create a virtual machine running Debian on Google Compute Engine (GCE). You can learn how to spin up a VM here. Make sure that you can SSH into your machine.\nInstalling Firefox\nWe're actually going to install Iceweasel. To the best of my knowledge, the only difference between Iceweasel and Firefox is the branding. To do this, we're going to:\n Update the sources list that apt-get uses to find packages. Edit the file /etc/apt/sources.list and add the line deb http://mozilla.debian.net/ wheezy-backports iceweasel-release. Update apt-get by running the command sudo apt-get update. Install Iceweasel by running the command sudo apt-get install -t wheezy-backports iceweasel.  I figured this out by searching for \u0026ldquo;iceweasel sources list\u0026rdquo;, which brought me to http://mozilla.debian.net/. If you're looking to install a different version of Iceweasel/Firefox or have a different version of Debian, check there.\nRunning Firefox\nWe can now run the browser we installed with the command firefox or iceweasel, but it will shut down because there is no display. To run the browser without a display (that is, to run it \u0026ldquo;headlessly\u0026rdquo;), we're going to:\n Install the display server Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) with the command sudo apt-get install xvfb. Start the display server with the command sudo Xvfb :10. Here, :10 is the server number we chose for the virtual display we're creating. Now run export DISPLAY=:10.  You should now be able to run firefox or iceweasel successfully.\nIf you'd like to see what's on your virtual display, Wikipedia provides an example of how to take a screenshot of your virtual display.\nInstalling Selenium\nWe can now run a headless version of Firefox. Since there's no user interface to click around in, the next logical step is to learn how to drive the browser. For this, we're going to set up Selenium in Python. When dealing with packages in Python, I recommend using pip inside a virtualenv with virtualenvwrapper. There are instructions for setting up these packages below.\nOnce you have virtualenvwrapper installed and you're safely working in a virtual environment, just issue the command pip install selenium to install selenium. If you're not in a virtualenv, you may need to issue the command with sudo.\nTry running this Python script to see if it's all working. It should take you to Google Images, search for cute kittens, and then save a screenshot to the file \u0026lsquo;adorable.png\u0026rsquo;.\n Installing virtualenvwrapper\nAs promised above, here is a section about virtualenvwrapper.\nManaging Python packages effectively is difficult, and I can't do the topic justice here. I recommend using virtualenvwrapper to help, and you can read more about how to do this here. For completeness, I'll briefly run through the steps of getting set up with pip, virtualenv, and virtualenvwrapper.\npip is Python's package manager. Once you have pip set up, you can run pip install package-name to install the package called package-name.\nTo set up pip, run the following commands:\n curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py \u0026gt; get-pip.py sudo python get-pip.py  virtualenv is a tool that let's you have different versions of Python and Python packages for different projects that you work on. Combined with virtualenvwrapper, it will help you avoid headaches of keeping track of where your various Python versions live and where they can find their packages on your machine.\nTo install virtualenv, run the command sudo pip install virtualenv.\nTo install virtualenvwrapper, run the command sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper.\nAdd the following three lines to your .bashrc or another startup script:\nexport WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs\nexport PROJECT_HOME=$HOME/Devel\nsource /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh\nYou're now ready to go. Learn more about how to use virtualenvwrapper effectively here.\nLast thoughts\nI hope you find this helpful. You can now install Firefox on Google Compute Engine, run it using a virtual display, and drive it using Selenium with Python. If something isn't working, or if something is working really well and has you super excited, I'm happy to talk it through with you. Email's the best way to contact me.

And they're wonderful. One of my favorite topics, really. People come to these things and they just code all night. Great experience. Tons of fun. Fruit. PacMan. Yadda, yadda, yadda.\nI tell people this all the time, and a pretty common response is \u0026ldquo;so, it's like a hackathon?\u0026rdquo;\nSo I think for a bit. There's coding. There's minimal sleeping. There are tech talks. There are pizzas, snacks, and refreshments. Fruit is hard to come by at a hackathon, but it can be there too. So I concede, \u0026ldquo;yeah, it's a bit like a hackathon.\u0026rdquo;\nBut I know we're wrong. Code@Night doesn't feel like a hackathon at all.\nHere, I made you an analogy. It's not a good one, but you can read it anyway. \u0026ldquo;A hackathon is to a Code@Night as a track race is to a stroll through a park.\u0026rdquo;\nOr for you symbolically minded folks\u0026hellip;\nHackathon : Code@Night :: Track race : Evening stroll How can they feel so different when the only core difference is that we've removed the competitive aspect?\nWell, in some ways Code@Night is a lot like a hackathon, but in others it's not at all. It's a hackathon minus the competition, plus the assortment of non-hackathon things that happen at Code@Nights. e.g. Pacman, the occasional contest, the tight-knit community, lots of fruit, a tech talk smack in the middle. Also, Code@Night runs for 12 hours in the worst case (if people stay for breakfast, we'll feed them), but more realistically only goes from 9 pm to 3-4 am. A hackathon usually lasts 24 hours or more.\nIt sounds like these are small differences from a hackathon, but it's really a completely different atmosphere. There's no start and end time for your project. You can work on the same thing Code@Night to Code@Night if you want. And people don't cluster into teams the way they do at hackathons. You also end up getting large group discussions going, which you rarely get at hackathons because people are rushed to work on their 24 hour product. No one's worrying about prizes or judges. You don't have to demo anything to feel accomplished (but we love demos! they're sure encouraged!) You can build what you want to build, not the thing you think will win over an audience.\nCode@Night isn't about starting. It isn't about finishing. It's about doing. It's about learning. It's about being a part of a community. By removing the artificial competitive aspects and time constraints that hackathons impose on coding, we're left with a really rewarding experience. People step back from their coding in ways they don't at hackathons. They teach about Python, about Hadoop. They sit in boxes (or put boxes on their heads). They share their projects. They debate bacterial growth characteristics on the surface of crisp orange-colored, peanut butter-flavored flakiness coated in compound chocolate. They talk about technology. And sometimes they write poetry.\nSo, the next time someone asks if a Code@Night is like a hackathon, I'll be ready with my \u0026ldquo;kinda, but not really, actually no\u0026rdquo; answer. And I'll be ready to say how they're different, and how I actually prefer the Code@Night. But hey, I'm biased, I organize the things.\nNext Code@Night? It's Sept 13, 9 pm. Sherrerd, Third Floor. Open to all Princetonites.

The last time I did an education-centric online Q+A was more than three years earlier. Let's take a look.\nOriginally posted at mathcounts.org in March 2010.\n**How long have you been a MATHCOUNTS coach?**\nThis is my second year coaching the Van Antwerp MATHCOUNTS team.\n**What is your favorite part about being a MATHCOUNTS coach?**\nIt's great to see my students having a good time with math. I love seeing their expressions when an idea becomes clear to them (an Aha! moment, as Martin Gardner would have it) or when they solve a challenging problem. I also like seeing their reactions to the problems I write. They seem to enjoy when I put their names into our practice problems. On some occasions, I'll have one idea in mind when I write a problem, but I'll make a typo that makes the question quite absurd. That's always fun to laugh about.\n**How do you prepare your students for MATHCOUNTS competitions?**\nLeading up to the Chapter Competition we met once a week after school. These meetings lasted 90 minutes, with a snack break (often called \u0026ldquo;Scoff Time!\u0026rdquo; in excited voices by the students) in the middle. After the team qualified for the State Competition we added a second shorter (45 minute) practice day to the week. On some days we practice with old MATHCOUNTS rounds. Other times we've played mathematical games such as variations of Greedy Pig and mathified versions of Jeopardy, Tic-Tac-Toe and Hangman. We've also experimented with a variety of practice formats including relays, topic-specific stations, and something akin to HMMT's Guts Round.\nBefore the Chapter Competition we also hosted a MATHCOUNTS scrimmage at Union College for six local MATHCOUNTS teams, so that the students got a chance to practice in a competition setting before the official contest date. At the scrimmage we also ran an unofficial Countdown Round for all the students interested in participating, which I had a lot of fun emceeing, and I think the students enjoyed as well.\n**What interesting techniques have you used in the classroom or after school with your students to get them excited about math?**\nWhen our final practice before the Chapter Competition was cancelled due to snow, I put together a set of problems for the team to solve before the competition. Each member of the team received one question by email. What was interesting about these problems was that each one depended on the answer to another. This encouraged the team members to work together in the days before the competition to find a set of solutions that satisfied all of the problems simultaneously.\nAnother technique is to encourage the students to share their methods of solving MATHCOUNTS problems with the rest of the team. By sharing their ideas, they frequently spot errors in their own work. Teaching is also a great way to become better versed in the material (that's one of the reasons I do this!), so its a great learning tool for everyone in the room. Often it is easier for someone on the team to explain a difficult concept to another student than for a coach to do this because the students have a better perspective on what parts of the idea are challenging or confusing. It helps a bit that I'm only a few years older than my team!\n**Why do you think math is so important for middle school students?**\nTo start, it can be fun. The problem solving skills that stem from practicing math are useful in all areas of life. Activities like MATHCOUNTS also help you to think faster and be more creative. And to fully appreciate the world around you or the daily news, it's really important to be comfortable around numbers.\nSpeaking as a high school student, I can also tell you that having a solid foundation in mathematics can be a big stress reducer in school, so it's great to get interested in math early!\n**Do you have any advice for Mathletes® hoping to advance in the Competition series?**\nPractice, ask questions, and develop a good sleep habit.\nAttending MATHCOUNTS practices is a great place to start, but there are so many ways to go beyond that in becoming a better problem solver. If you're clever with a search engine, you'll find there are tons of resources available including problems on the MATHCOUNTS website, these MATHCOUNTS drills, Mr. Diaz's MATHCOUNTS Bible, and Coach Monks’s MATHCOUNTS Playbook. Get together with members of your team to practice outside of school. Use problems you find online or, better yet, write your own, and don't forget to ask your parents to provide you with a snack.\nIf ever there are problems you don't understand (and this should happen very often), ask about them. At practice it can be difficult to get to all of them because there is so much to do in so little time, but don't limit your questions to your practices. Talk to or email your coach or teachers or siblings or parents or friends or friends\u0026rsquo; parents. Anyone might have the knowledge or insight to answer/explore your questions.\n**What advice would you give to new coaches just starting a MATHCOUNTS program?**\nHave fun with it, and your students will have fun too (at least in principle, anyhow). Chances are your students will know things and ask things you don't know or can't answer, and that's good. Being a coach is an opportunity to learn as well as to teach.\nThe most important advice I can leave you with (keep in mind I have more experience as a student than as a coach) to get your MATHCOUNTS team off the ground, though, is to provide snacks. I recommend grapes, as they're healthy, tasty, easy to distribute, and avoid the majority of allergy problems.\n","date":1376611200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1376611200,"objectID":"9e4eefd2333c0f5a9af34bcdba246d23","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/post/2013-08-16-mathcounts-coach-q-and-a/","publishdate":"2013-08-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2013-08-16-mathcounts-coach-q-and-a/","section":"post","summary":"Last week I did a Q+A for the Life at KA blog.

Are you related to Justin Bieber?\nIt's funny you should ask that. People tell me all the time \u0026ldquo;sorry about your last name\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I hope you're not related to that singer\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;can you get me free tickets to the Bieber concert?\u0026rdquo; And because of that, I've started feeling a real connection to the guy. I root for his success. I feel down when people trash his music. I think we could become genuinely good friends if we weren't both vying for the top spot on Google for the search term \u0026ldquo;Bieber.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd no, I don't listen to his music (much).\nSo, Bieber, how did you come to work at Khan Academy?\nSounds like life story time.\nI had some pretty incredible teachers growing up. Lots of them. And not just the grown-up kind \u0026ndash; the peer kind too. Throughout middle and high school I was involved in this fantastic math community, the Albany Area Math Circle. We practiced loads of competition math, and most of what I learned, I learned from other students. Some a few years older than me, some a few years younger.\nHere I got involved in coaching MathCounts, and I quickly realized that I love teaching. I ran a math camp for middle school students one summer and I had a blast doing it. Whatever I was going to do with my life, it was going to involve teaching in some capacity.\nFast forward a couple years, and I'm sitting in a dining hall in some castle in Princeton. I'm talking with some friends about startup ideas \u0026ndash; I have a lot of friends interested in entrepreneurship \u0026ndash; and I have a brilliant idea for a company. (I love getting lost in the excitement of a good idea.) \u0026ldquo;We'll take classes, and we'll put them online. Just Princeton classes to start \u0026ndash; it'll be like MIT's OpenCourseWare \u0026ndash; but we'll make it scalable. And any student with their professor's permission will be able to really easily get their classes\u0026rsquo; lectures online.\u0026rdquo; Sounds a bit like Coursera. Or YouTube. From there on out, I gave a lot of thought to teaching at scale.\nWhich brings us to Khan Academy. I'm interested in programming and technology and education, and I'm all for making the world a better place. What better way than the KA way to leverage my interests to facilitate teaching at scale?\nWait\u0026hellip; You said you were sitting in a castle?\nYeah, half the buildings on campus are castles. But that's not the best thing about Princeton. The best thing about Princeton is Code@Night (though I'm biased \u0026ndash; I organize them). Every two to three weeks there's a Code@Night where people gather in this beautiful non-castle building called Sherrerd to code at night. Usually a student or professor or an engineer from a sponsor company will give a tech talk or a demo. People will code all night, they'll play PacMan and eat pizza. Sometimes they'll write poetry. It's really an incredible experience. There are even whiteboards all along the walls making it an ideal environment for puzzles.\nDo you have a puzzle you could share with us?\nSure. Here's one that was going around the KA office recently.\nThere are one hundred prisoners in a prison, and the warden is a bit too much of a puzzle enthusiast. She finds an empty jail cell, and into it puts one hundred boxes. Under each box she puts the name of one of the prisoners, so every prisoner's name appears under precisely one box.\nThen she tells the prisoners this:\nEach one of you will be led individually into the jail cell with one hundred boxes. Under one of these boxes is your name. You will each be allowed to look under 50 boxes, but if even one of you doesn't find your own name, all one hundred of you will be locked away forever. That said, if all of you find your own name then you will be freed immediately.\nThe prisoners are terrified, but also excited. They love puzzles too. Help them form a strategy to maximize the chance that they'll be granted their freedom.\nSome caveats: Once the prisoners start going into the cell with the boxes, no communication between the prisoners is allowed. And the prisoners cannot make any modifications to the room with the boxes either \u0026ndash; no leaving boxes turned over, no writing on the walls, and no taking boxes out of the room or moving them, even the one with your name under it.\nGood luck.\nSounds tough. What's the answer?\nPshhh, don't give up yet. It's a really good puzzle. Who's asking these questions, anyway?\nThat'd be me. David Bieber.\nSo what you're telling me is that I'm involved in a virtual interview\u0026hellip; with myself?\nYeah.\nAnd to think I thought the Turing test was hard\u0026hellip; why are you writing all this anyway?\nWell, it's good to take a break from coding every now and again. Plus, I really like having people read the things I write \u0026ndash; I found this out after starting my blog a year ago (take a look!) \u0026ndash; it makes the writing process a lot more fun. It also gives you all a better feel for life at Khan Academy, and that transparency is really valuable. We’re real people who make KA run! Seeing all the awesome stuff on this blog is part of why I came to work here. But most of all, the writing really is fun! Especially the Bieber bit \u0026ndash; I had a good time writing that.

And as an added bonus, the person you're teaching learns too.\nI strongly believe that you, as someone who has found themselves reading strange blogs on the internet, have a lot to offer the world in the way of teaching. So I want you to teach at scale. Yes, I'm looking at you Mom and Dad, former Facebook and Twitter interns, my fellow interns here at Khan Academy. I'm looking at you, my Princeton and Nisky friends, and my former MathCounts students. Yes, even you, HackerNews readers and Google searchers and friends of friends. I want you to give teaching at scale a try.\nIt's hard. Don't mislead yourself into thinking this is an easy task that I've laid out for you. It takes courage and confidence. When you teach at scale, you make yourself vulnerable. You have to be ready for people to catch your mistakes and challenge your teachings. People will out-think you, and you should be ready to embrace that.\nWhat, then, should you teach? I offer two suggestions. 1) Teach what you want to learn, and 2) teach what you know best. Sometimes the best teachers are not those with 10 years of teaching experience in a subject, but rather the people who remember what it's like not to know. Teach something while the Aha! moment that helped you understand it is still fresh in your mind. The second suggestion, teach what you know best, sounds obvious, but the reason behind it has some subtlety. Don't teach what you know best because you'll probably avoid mistakes on that topic \u0026ndash; do it because it's something you can speak passionately about. If your teachings get a student genuinely excited about a topic, that is worth so much more than having them quickly master it.\nSo how should you get started? The simplest way is to blog. You can set up a blog and be started writing in minutes by signing up at tumblr.com. Once you've written something educational, share it with your friends and with online communities. Related to technology? Post it on HackerNews.\nDIY method two of teaching at scale is to make YouTube videos. I gave this a try making videos teaching Item Response Theory and Bloom Filters. Here's my setup.\nIt's a piece of cardboard with a hole cut out of it for a camera to look through, mounted above some paper. I used my iPhone as the camera.\nHere are the resulting Bloom Filter videos, mistakes and stuttering and blurriness and all. I'm pretty embarrassed by them, and I'm hoping future videos I produce will come out better.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTFg4cPjhl-2nrkIR1z_MSTcxNeyPk4PO\nI'm going to continue to make videos as I learn awesome things over the years, and I hope you do the same.\nHow you teach at scale is up to you. Blog. Make videos. Post code. Start a math circle.\nBe creative. The most effective teachers-at-scale are not always those who leverage technology to reach a wide audience. They are those who teach passionately, and in doing so infect others with a love for learning and teaching.\n","date":1375837200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1375837200,"objectID":"d6170353fb14da08dd778dc58905fc86","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/post/2013-08-07-teach-at-scale/","publishdate":"2013-08-07T01:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2013-08-07-teach-at-scale/","section":"post","summary":"The best way to learn is to teach.

Scroll down and skip to the code. That's the good part anyway.\nOne of the beauties of programming is the elimination of redundant aspects of life that you find yourself doing over and over again. When you find yourself calling home every weekend, logging hours at your job daily, or getting your hair cut every month, it's time to learn to program. Write a short script to do these repetitive behaviors for you. Just kidding. Don't.\nThese are joke examples \u0026ndash; I strongly advise against automating discussions with your mother \u0026ndash; but they aren't so farfetched. Automating processes - shopping, shipping, server maintenance - save countless hours and dollars. Here, we'll do a thought experiment: imagine a team of people running Amazon.com without automation. As a crude estimate, let's suppose they sell a mere billion books each year. Let's imagine they only handle 1% of all Internet traffic. And let's pretend they only store 1 trillion objects in their S3 storage system. Then with their team of about ninety thousand, each Amazon employee would have to be selling and shipping 30 books a day on top of processing and transmitting over 100 gigabytes of Internet traffic daily, all while handling requests for a hundred thousand S3 objects that they've had to memorize. Maybe Jeff Bezos could pull it off. But you're not Jeff Bezos, so I'd say it's worth your time to learn to automate.\nEven education is being automated these days. Will the next century's robotic overloads prove to be better professors than the ones we grew up with? To which you may reply: \u0026ldquo;Oh gee whiz! I sure hope we get better robotic overloads in the future! The ones I grew up with were just miserable professors.\u0026rdquo; But that's not what I meant. I'm asking whether Khan Academies and Duolingos will replace our real life Ms. Frizzles and Mrs. Gorfs. A brief excursion with Duolingo makes me suspect it will be a major part of all future language educations. This seems counterintuitive. Languages are inherently about communication. The best way to learn a language should necessarily involve communicating (and the very best way will probably forever remain immersion, but often that's not an option). Conversation and human interaction are so fundamental to language learning that it seems almost absurd that a computer could be a good language teacher, at least until we have strong AI. But the computer manages to do one thing extraordinarily well that isn't scalable in a traditional classroom; the computer focuses entirely on me. So, yes, it lacks creativity and the personal touch of a great teacher. It doesn't tell funny stories or crack foreign language jokes. It doesn't show cute movies and it can't relate to me at all. Yet despite all these shortcomings, it's remarkably good at helping me learn the basics of a foreign language, because it can focus on me, going at my pace and not having to devote its efforts to maintaining the attention of 30 other students.\nAutomation has clearly been taking over everywhere for years. You have to join it. It's a real life superpower. So let's learn to automate something basic. We'll go with software: a Python script to send emails.\nI present: the code. You can run it as is. Save it as a file and run it with Python, and it should just work out of the box. Go ahead, try it.\n Awesome. You just sent me an email. What good is this code? Tweak it a bit and you can use it for personal alerts \u0026ndash; systematically check when you're low on milk and email yourself a reminder \u0026ndash; have your computer email you daily with upcoming birthdays; you can even have it buy the gifts. You can email yourself automatically when a course opens up on your registrar's website. We'll talk about auto-enrolling another time. Or you can set up a script to send different versions of emails to different people, like those spam emails that pretend to be personal by including your first name.\nWith great power comes great responsibility. Don't send spam.\nWith a new Python library in your toolbox, I hope you save yourself thousands of hours. Until next time, try to stay dry.\nDiscuss on Hacker News.\n","date":1363132800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1363132800,"objectID":"deebaab7376ddb19227034b13f786445","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/post/2013-03-13-automate-your-life-sending-emails/","publishdate":"2013-03-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2013-03-13-automate-your-life-sending-emails/","section":"post","summary":"Use Python to send emails programmatically.","tags":["Automation"],"title":"Automate Your Life: Sending Emails","type":"post"},{"authors":["David Bieber"],"categories":null,"content":"Every pawn is an inverted Lorenz attractor.

It gets more complex over time, but nothing insurmountable. In the beginning, your path is pretty much laid out. You have some control over what directions you go, and these are important decisions. They'll shape your future. They'll change what opportunities you have down the road. But as important as they are, there are relatively few wrong decisions. Sure, you can screw up at any point, including early on. And sometimes the damage is irreparable. As my dad always says, \u0026ldquo;avoid the big mistakes.\u0026rdquo; Aim high, and lay a foundation for yourself to grow. Act with a focus on making your situation the best it can be, always with an eye toward the future. It's the most important thing you can focus on with so much still ahead of you, with so much still unseen.\nLife is all about people. It's about interactions. It's important to realize this, that what you decide to make of a situation has a wide impact, bigger than yourself. When you change the world, you change it for everyone. And when you think to yourself, \u0026ldquo;what should I do now?\u0026rdquo; you also have to think about how others will respond. How will things be different down the road? How will things be different just a few minutes from now? The person sitting across from you: she has her own mind, her own motives. Your intentions and hers- sometimes they align nicely, fitting together perfectly and making both of you better off. But often they don't mesh and they get in each other's way. One must always be wary of this.\nIt's interesting that children don't understand this at first. People don't develop a theory of mind until the age of three or four. Until then, they don't grasp that people have different experiences, different thoughts, and different aspirations. Some people with autism spectrum disorders experience a deficit in their theory of mind that lasts beyond childhood, making life supremely difficult. It's very unfortunate. It takes time before children begin grasp the complexities of life, and at first they cannot puzzle out how others think and how others will behave. Over time, one develops a more analytic mind and the puzzles of behavior become simultaneously more understood and more mysterious.\nTake any individual piece of life and you'll find it mostly transparent. It's a beautiful, colorful thing, completely understandable, devoid of mystery and yet full of wonder. With thoughtful reasoning, you can pretty much figure out how it fits into the bigger picture. Yet the bigger picture itself, like a stained glass window, is so full of intricacies that even with a remarkable attention to detail it seems there is always more to explore. There is always, it seems, another possibility to consider.\nWhen the pieces of life stack up against each other, the transparency fades. It becomes hard to distinguish one thing from another. Important decisions are more difficult to make, yet remain even more consequential than any before. Sometimes you may look out and see something that really excites you: a thought so fun and so novel it drives you to action; you get the idea that everything fits together so nicely. But there's always something missing. That one piece of the puzzle that you can't find, and nothing will fill this void. With everything looking so good, like everything was where it was meant to be, the only way to go from here is down. Your choices are no longer clear, and you can't tell one from another. What to do? What to do?\nThere are tough decisions with trade-offs and you simply cannot please everyone. Know what situation you're in, your strengths and your weaknesses. Lay out your possible decisions clearly in front of you. Organize. Evaluate. You mustn't rush into big decisions.\nWhen you're in a tough spot, as you surely will be, do not despair. You may be tempted to look back on your past with regret. Hindsight is 20/20. You couldn't have known about that poor decision, that wasted opportunity. It's a sunk expenditure and you must make the best of your current situation. Sometimes you'll feel like you don't fit in, and that's just part of life.\nAs life progresses, you will have more decisions to make with higher impact. You take on more responsibility with your actions and you have more meaningful interactions with other people. Setting goals, and having them mesh with the goals of others is important. My dad and I agreed to each do 180 days of push-ups and sit-ups this year. Whether or not this sort of goal will lead to success in life is questionable, but having an objective like this is useful. Goals must not be unrealistic, and you should be aware that sometimes it may feel like the world is conspiring against you, and perhaps it is. But often it's not, and when things don't go as planned there is no one to blame but yourself. I've set out to become a better storyteller this year. Stories, to me, have a lot of value, and they certainly make life more interesting.\nIt is often said a goal should be objective and measurable. For a goal such as storytelling, though, that seems absurd. Progress here can only be measured by a good tale.\nLife, we all know, eventually comes to an end. And as it does so, think about what you want to leave behind. Where do you want your possessions to go? You can't take them with you. So be charitable, and get rid of as much as you can afford. As much as the world is ready for. Think of those who will follow you, and ask yourself how will they feel about your end. Did you leave them in a good situation? Perhaps you set them up to finish soon, just as you did.\nThink of everything. It's all about strategy. Life is a game.\nSorry, have I been writing life? I meant Blokus.\nBlokus is a game.\nHere's the gist.

Clone the django-appfog-helloworld repository. Push to AppFog.  The repository is available at https://github.com/dbieber/django-appfog-helloworld.\nHere's what comes with this repo.\nIt's a Django project that works out of the box (just download it and python manage.py runserver. If you have Django installed, it'll work!). It's already setup to serve static files. It's all ready to use MySQL or sqlite3. It ships with Bootstrap and jQuery. Django's admin app is enabled and ready to go. It has templates for 404 and 500 errors so you can quickly see how to get error handling working. And it has one app, named app_name, that demonstrates the core functionality of Django: models, views, templating, and forms, by collecting email address of early users to your site. It's a rudimentary version of LaunchRock.\nMy hope is that it will work well both as start code and as reference code for how to get Django working quickly.\nThis template is great for quick and dirty websites. It's perfect for a hackathon or for prototyping an idea with friends. And it's a great template for getting started with Django, Bootstrap, and jQuery. But it's not production quality in two key respects, security and scalability. Keep that in mind as you start building. Now, let's dive deeper into getting your Django app running.\nSetting up AppFog Register for an account at AppFog.com.\nCreate a new \u0026ldquo;Django Python\u0026rdquo; app. Host it on AWS. And give it a name. I called mine \u0026ldquo;helloworld-django\u0026rdquo;. Let's say you call yours name_of_app.\nYou'll want to set up the af command line utility to make deploying your site easier later. On Mac or Unix this is as simple as gem install af. Windows instructions are simple too, and are available in the \u0026ldquo;Update Source Code\u0026rdquo; tab of your app on AppFog.\n(Optional) Make sure you have a MySQL database service provisioned. To do this, log in to AppFog, choose your app, and choose the \u0026ldquo;Services\u0026rdquo; tab. You can either bind an existing MySQL database service to your app or create a new one. If you don't have a MySQL database provisioned, the app we deploy in a moment will use sqlite3 as a fallback and should work just fine.\nCloning this repository git clone https://github.com/dbieber/django-appfog-helloworld.git\nThe web app is already all ready to be pushed to AppFog.\nBefore you go and push this website live, there are a few things you should do, all marked with TODO in the source code you just downloaded. These are the most important:\n Set your SECRET_KEY in settings.py Set up the ADMINS variable in settings.py Set default admin account credentials in views.py Always be aware of whether DEBUG = True or DEBUG = False in settings.py. This changes how errors are handled and you definitely want DEBUG set to false when your site is public.  Now you're ready to go live!\nPushing to AppFog Be sure to either run python manage.py collectstatic or place all your static files your static directory before pushing.\nLog in to AppFog with the command af login. (Find instructions for setting up the command line tool in the \u0026ldquo;Update Source Code\u0026rdquo; tab of your app on AppFog.com.\nFrom inside the django-appfog-helloworld directory (which, by the way, you are free to rename) run af update name_of_app.\nThat's it. Your site is live! You're already collecting email address of beta-testers. Huzzah!\nTesting Locally To test locally, you'll need to install Django.\nTo test your app locally, navigate to the django-appfog-helloworld directory containing manage.py:\npython manage.py runserver runs your app locally. View it at localhost:8000. python manage.py syncdb sets up your local database by default in a file called dev.db. python manage.py collectstatic copies all your static files into your static files directory. python manage.py help for more.\nDjango is a Python based web framework with excellent documentation and tutorials.

I’m curious, so feel free to let me know before reading further (Google form).\nPersonally, there are a just a handful of use cases that make up the vast majority of my email usage. Let’s list them.\nOrganizing talks and events for ACM and Splash! Applications for summer internships Read-only-ish mail (Mailing lists announcing talks and events, class related announcements, discussions I minimally partake in, spam, etc.) Talking with friends For about three months now, I’ve been thinking that email is woefully insufficient for managing my communication needs, particularly use cases 1 and 2. When I’m organizing a Code@Night I’ll often have 3 or more email threads related to the event. In one I’ll be discussing logistics with a company sponsor. In another I’ll be coordinating with other ACM officers. In still another I’ll announce the event to groups around campus. Often even more form when people start replying about how awesome it is that there will be fruit at the event or asking how they can contribute to making the world a better place.\nI thought about how I could improve email so that managing all these communications could be better. Better ways of grouping conversations, by person or by event, would be nice. Having an indicator of what still had to be done and who I still needed to contact would be nice. I realized I could do all of this with Gmail already, combining labels and searches in clever ways. But that would be clunky, and so I was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled upon Streak.\nStreak seems to be targeting sales and recruiting folks, and I think that’s the wrong audience for them. Their product was clearly designed with the sales-recruiting person in mind, but I think it’s equally well suited for the hacker, and not just for tracking bugs. To demonstrate this, I’ll write a bit about what the product does and how I’m using it.\nI have two use cases for Streak so far, corresponding to email uses 1 and 2 in the list above. I use Streak for organizing events and for managing my applications for summer internships. I don’t know that either of these are use cases intended by the folks over at Streak. For organizing events (primarily tech talks and Code@Nights), I have a “Pipeline” in Streak called ACM Events. Into a Pipeline go boxes, one box per event. And a box contains all the emails, documents, comments, and other information pertaining to the event. It’s simple to add an email thread to a box, so I’m always able to keep everything relevant to a particular event in one easily accessible place in the Gmail web client. As the event goes from being just an idea to a complete plan to being successfully executed, its box moves through the pipeline. In this way I can quickly get at all events in a particular part of the planning process or event lifecycle, and I have a convenient archive of all past events.\nFor managing my summer internship applications, Streak has also proved useful. I have a box for each company to which I’m applying. And I put all the emails and documents for that company’s application into the appropriate box. On the company’s end, I’m probably being moved through a hiring pipeline in a similar CRM tool, and now the company is moving through my CRM’s pipeline in parallel.\nThe box and pipeline model took me a bit of tinkering with to really grok. It’s a paradigm shift that takes some getting used to. The email primitive is no longer the conversation, but instead is the thing you are trying to accomplish through the conversation. Say I need to reply to a Facebook recruiter about planning a tech talk here at Princeton. Now rather than using Gmail search to look for a particular email thread I vaguely recall having (perhaps by guessing at words that were in the thread or by scrolling through my email to the date I remember the email having been sent), I simply go to the box I created for the event, and all of the relevant emails are right there. This sounds a lot like labels, but has the distinct advantage that boxes are much more light weight than labels. Once you have more than a dozen labels or so, they become clunky and start cluttering up the Gmail navigation bar.\nDon’t just take my word for it.

I flew out of Princeton yesterday with a group of 20 to spend the week visiting technology companies, startups and venture capitalists in Silicon Valley. We're going company to company hearing founder's stories, discussing entrepreneurship, and as we do this I am forced to introspect. What do I want to do with my life? How can I make a difference?\nMy passion is education. I was fortunate enough to have some amazing mentors growing up, and to learn in a lot of diverse ways most people never have a chance to experience. I tried out gifted programs, nerd camps, one-on-one classes, online self paced learning, the works. I got involved in math circles, I took summer classes, I really was blessed to have every educational opportunity one could hope for. This, and the diversity of amazing teachers I've had has gotten me thinking about how people learn best, and how I learn best. Complementing this interest well, I've found I really love teaching- particularly math and computer science to younger students. It's always a joy helping someone to tackle the Bessie the Cow problem or the game of Nim for the very first time.\nToday a lot of young companies bring together my interests of education, computer science and technology. Websites like Coursera, edX, and Udacity virtualize the university experience, and Khan Academy joins them in making quality education accessible everywhere. Startups like Lore and Piazza foster discussions around classes, allowing the learning experience to extend more seamlessly beyond the walls of the classroom.\nToday we trekked over to the new office of Khan Academy where our group got to sit down and discuss education with Sal Khan, and then we were off to Piazza's office where we did Q+A with the question-answer site's founder, Pooja Sankar.\nSal Khan is a really inspirational person. His collection of tutorials - which now spans a wide range of topics including mathematics and organic chemistry and art history - It all began with Sal tutoring his cousins over the phone back in 2004. Hearing him tell his founding story - how he went from tutoring one cousin, to many, to posting videos on YouTube and being well received all over the world. how he came to tutor the Gates children through his videos, and how after discussions with venture capitalists in the valley Sal made the choice to incorporate Khan Academy as a non-profit - Hearing this story from Sal Khan really drove home how empowering technology is and how tech is shaping the future of education. One smart man with a gift for explaining things clearly now teaches millions of students, an unprecedented feat since most lecture halls barely seat one hundred.\nWith the resources Khan Academy is producing, the purpose of the classroom is shifting. Lecture time in classes is becoming less and less valuable, and some classes have adopted a flipped classroom model. Students watch the Khan Academy videos at home, and then come to class with an understanding of the material. Students then use the class time to try out problems that would previously have been homework, now in a setting where they can get immediate help from their peers and their teacher. The flipped classroom model has been highly successful so far. One of Khan Academy's ambitions is to, when someone comes to the site to learn about multiplication, be able to first offer an education on addition or any other prerequisites of the subject. Or after learning about one topic, they'd love to provide an education on the next logical thing to study. They've done a fine job of this with their knowledge map of mathematics. Each skill from 1-digit addition to calculus and linear algebra is connected with its prerequisites. Where this problem gets interesting, and where I'm excited to see what Khan Academy does in this space, is with more specialized subject matter. It will be interesting to see how this can be presented when the relationships between material stops being [understanding X is required to know Y] and starts being [X is related to Y] or [X is a good tutorial to follow for people who struggled with Y].\nThe data that Khan Academy is receiving about its millions of users puts the organization in a fantastic place for improving education. By the sheer number of users, there will always be groups of students studying the same material. In order to achieve this with a traditional education, students were forced to learn at the same rate as their twenty classmates. The class would drag slower students forward, and hold the brightest back. With Khan Academy students can devour mathematics at whatever rate they please, and there will still be folks online learning the same things as them. Self paced learning isn't new. John Hopkin's has offered it through their CTY programs for a long time, and MIT's OpenCourseWare has provided content for free for years, but the content has never been open, free, and as community based as it can be today. Khan Academy could bring these students, all learning the same material at the same time, together, perhaps even offline. Study groups like this are popping up all over the world out of Coursera classes. People meet up to watch the lectures together or help each other through homework problems. That's a fantastic way to learn.\nThere's so much to be gained from this sort of interaction. And there's so much to be learned from a group of students working on mathematics together, even when they're all at different skill levels. Traditional classrooms cluster students by grade; they're all learning the same content at the same time, and they have been their whole lives following the same sequence through mathematics as each other. With students learning at their own pace on Khan Academy, it will be great to see a classroom with a wide spectrum of mathematical ability. The sort of learning that takes place when a fast-paced student, studying algebra ahead of his class, works with a peer struggling to master long division is rare and really valuable. This is the type of interaction I expect will arise naturally out of making K-12 mathematics a self paced endeavor while maintaining the traditional 5 days a week classroom setting.\nOne other amazing thing that Khan Academy, Coursera, and these other online education websites will be doing is individualizing the teaching experience. I already mentioned how Khan Academy could recommend different tutorials based on your performance or ability or interests. The individualization that can be done can also take place at a finer level. Coursera co-founder Daphne Koller came to Princeton to speak recently and she explained some of the work being done in this area. The data that Coursera is receiving from students is tremendous in quality and volume. With classes of tens of thousands of people, a single numerical answer question will garner hundreds of different answers. There will be clusters in these answers, with thousands of people submitting the same incorrect response. This gives professors insights into the minds of their students they never had before. With this information, we can figure out exactly what sorts of mistakes are common, and how to avoid them. People likely to make a particular type of mistake can be shown content in a way tailored to them. There may be groups of people who tend to share patterns in which mistakes they make, or which types of material they're good at. The scale at which these courses are being offered and at which the feedback is being received will allow for insights into teaching that were never possible before.\nThat said, I think that while online education is young and still in its stage of constant iteration, feedback should be collected much more explicitly. The value of people's behavior on Khan Academy, Coursera, edX, Udacity, etc should not be understated, but these companies could learn so much more about their content and how students and \u0026ldquo;users\u0026rdquo; respond to their content it they merely asked. If Coursera put up two buttons next to their videos, one labeled \u0026ldquo;boring\u0026rdquo; and one labeled \u0026ldquo;interesting\u0026rdquo; (or \u0026ldquo;simple\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;confusing\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;easy\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;hard\u0026rdquo;), or if they placed a feedback box underneath their video lectures, then I think the professors offering the courses would have a much better understanding of their audience. As it is, with both online lectures and live lectures, the professor gets very little feedback. They wonder Are my student's understanding what I'm saying? Am I going to fast? Too slow? Is that kid in the orange shirt snoring?. This is one area where over the next year we have to leverage technology better. We need to get this feedback cycle right soon. These are the days that content is being produced at an incredible rate. The Khan Academy videos that go up this year, the Coursera classes being recorded every day - this is content that will last forever, and as we produce more of it, it's so important that we maintain the highest possible standards, and for that feedback is critical.\nWhile quality is important, so too is the opportunity for everyone to become a teacher. More on those thoughts another day. We won't all produce lectures with the quality of Sal Khan or Kevin Wayne. It is primarily at the top that we must ensure the content is the best it can possibly be. Still, feedback from students is so important to anyone teaching in any capacity.\nThis notion, allowing anyone to teach, is so fundamental to the way education has to be. People learn from other people. Lore understands this. Piazza understands this. This is the philosophy that makes Albany Area Math Circle such an incredible group. This is why college campuses thrive and produce innovation. During our visit with Piazza, founder Pooja Sankar spoke about (in addition to teaching us some great lessons in entrepreneurship from the company's founding story) Piazza's mission to take down barriers to learning. Piazza is really succeeding in this. They've empowered people so that everyone in the class can be the teacher in a way that's never worked in lecture classes before.\nGoing forward, only good can come of these trends toward moving education online. Khan Academy's mission seems inevitable. A world class education is becoming available to anyone, anywhere. The best ways to make this happen are still being discovered, and there's so much to explore in the world of online pedagogy. This is something to be excited about. This is something I want to be a part of.\n","date":1351555200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1351555200,"objectID":"ba02a3051a7f60bda1f85b700b42de16","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/post/2012-10-30-thoughts-on-education/","publishdate":"2012-10-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2012-10-30-thoughts-on-education/","section":"post","summary":"That concludes day one of the TigerTrek.

I’m a big fan of Scrabble. I love math, puzzles, and playing tennis. I spend a lot of my would-be-free time on Coursera. And I’m vice chair of Princeton’s ACM Group.\nACM stands for Association for Computing Machinery, but that’s not important. I think that name is silly.\nOne of ACM’s main functions on campus is “promoting interest in computing and it’s applications.” That’s from the ACM Constitution, and it’s a beautiful goal, a goal helped along by Code@Nights, and a goal that I encourage you to participate in. Let’s start with Code@Nights, then I’ll point out how you can make a difference.\nIn short, a Code@Night is a fun-filled night of coding, powered by enthusiasm, extension cords, pizza and drinks. That’s right! Enthusiasm :D!\nPersonally, I find all nights of coding are fun-filled, but having a Code@Night guarantees it. Here’s how a typical Code@Night goes. Step 1, the ACM Officers (lovely people by the way) pick a date for the Code@Night and we book a room in the best building on Princeton’s campus, Sherrerd Hall. Sometime we’ll pick a theme (like quines or stenography!) as well.\nSherrerd Hall: We send out an email (and in this case a blog post) to the ACM Group at Princeton, and everybody marks the date on their calendar, because nobody likes to miss a Code@Night.\nThen, hours before the Code@Night begins, the ACM Officers (did I mention how wonderful they are?) scramble to get snacks and beverages ready for the Code@Night, and they inevitably end up with a bit too much Red Bull and Mountain Dew, and never enough fresh fruit.\nThe fruit is very important to the success of a Code@Night. Sure, hackers will show up because you advertise pizza and sugary things, but after a long night of coding, fresh fruit will bring a smile to any developer’s face.\nAround 9pm, the hackery folks begin to arrive. They’ll keep on arriving until well after midnight, so we’re sure to keep the pizza coming and the drinks flowing. Sometimes we’ll plan a tech talk or demos to liven up the night. They come, they code, they conquer. They discuss the latest hacker news. They make the latest hacker news. They share their ideas and expertise with one another, and build pretty cool stuff. And when they’re tired, or realize they have to wake up early the next day for that big Dropbox interview, they leave at 1, 2, 3 in the morning, sometimes later.\nOur next Code@Night is this Friday, September 14, and is open to the Princeton Community. Located on the 3rd Floor of Sherrerd.\nMost of you probably aren’t Princeton students, but still want to attend a Code@Night. To you, I say “make one!” Find a room and shoot an email out to your computer sciencey and hacker friends. Order some pizza and be enthusiastic. And don’t forget the fruit. And when the event is a roaring success, let me know @Bieber or by email: dbieber@princeton.edu! Try it, you’ll like it.\nPrinceton students: I hope to see you there.\nFriday Sept 14, 2012, 9pm - whenever, 3rd Floor Sherrerd Hall","date":1347926400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1347926400,"objectID":"781f9bcb813877f7b9c09d7d4eb42e22","permalink":"https://davidbieber.com/post/2012-09-18-whats-a-code-at-night/","publishdate":"2012-09-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2012-09-18-whats-a-code-at-night/","section":"post","summary":"Check out this video showing what Code@Nights are all about!\nSince you’re reading my blog, you should know a little bit about myself.

It's my introduction to the world of blogging, the blog post likely only read by my family and a few techie friends. It's the post in which I make an unrealistic commitment to blog frequently, which I later fail to live up to. And it's the post in which I introduce a new form of blogging, Collapsible Blogging. Here's the tl;dr.\nHello World!\nClick any part of this post to see it in condensed form.\nSource is here: https://gist.github.com/3616675 Click stuff to collapse. Click again to expand.\nBefore we get into the details of Collapsible Blogging, let's start with that commitment to blog. Every half-baked blog has it, so here's mine. Once a month. I know my life is sufficiently not boring that something blog-worthy will come along each month. Why, just last Tuesday I ran with Tyson Mao (yeah, the Rubik's Cube guy) and had a near encounter with Top Gear's Richard Hammond (he came by Twitter while I was interning there). This post counts for September. So you'll be hearing from me next at least before Halloween's end. Here's to a happy, healthy, blogging career!\nI'll blog once a month. And I like name dropping.\nSo, how's this whole Collapsible Blogging thing work, why is it awesome, and how can you try it out? Collapsible Blogging works well with my own internet content consumption habits, which I believe I share with many of the other Hacker News obsessed entrepreneurial spirited folks out there on the internet. Possibly you. I choose an interesting Hacker News article, I read a bit, and I quickly lose interest in favor of another well titled article. My goal is really just to consume quickly the highlights of the web. Collapsible Blogging let's me skim faster. But maybe that's a not a good thing. I'm rereading Fahrenheit 451- and there's a passage this reminds me of:\n\u0026ldquo;I sometimes think drivers don't know what grass is, or flowers, because they never see them slowly,\u0026rdquo; and\n\u0026ldquo;Have you seen the two-hundred-foot-long billboards in the country beyond town? Did you know that once billboards were only twenty feet long? But cars started rushing by so quickly they had to stretch the advertising out so it would last.\u0026rdquo; I don't want Collapsible Blogging to be those two-hundred-foot-long billboards.\nUse Collapsible Blogging to make your content easier to skim. So with that in mind, I introduce the second use of Collapsible Blogging. Diving deeper into a topic. If you'd like to learn more about diving deeper into a topic, click this passage. Collapsible Blogging let's people who aren't interested in the topic read quickly, while people like yourselves who want the full blog post can read more in a single click, as you just discovered. One application of this is resumes. On my resume I list that I have experience with Java, Python, etc. An employer may care just about my lovely Python experience, but my resume doesn't go into details about each technical skill and where I've used them. If I build my resume with Collapsible Blogging, I can make it so that with a single click potential employers can learn more about my experience with just the skills that interests them. They can learn what matters to them without me cluttering my resume with every project I've ever worked on. Likewise, say I write a blog post about my experiences at Twitter and Facebook. You might be interested in reading about the technical challenges I faced and the programming concepts I learned, while another reader might be more curious about the pool party I attended at Zuck's house. If I write my post using Collapsible Blogging, you, the reader, can choose to read about the parts of my experience that interest you most, or you can choose to just skim the collapsed form of the post. Some paragraphs don't have collapsed forms. You can only collapse the passages with a left border. There isn't really a shorter way to say that!  If you're interested in using Collapsible Blogging yourself, it's remarkable easy. I include the source as a gist below. Each passage that I want to collapse, I give an id. Then I create an element with the same id but preceded by an underscore. The CSS below hides elements with ids starting with underscores, and the JS below uses JQuery to handle the swapping in and out of elements. If you're blogging with Tumblr, just paste the code into your theme and you're good to go! Anywhere else, it should be as simple as adding the JS and CSS to your page. Try it.
