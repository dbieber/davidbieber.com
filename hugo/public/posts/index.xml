      <description>Last week I did a Q+A for the Life at KA blog. The last time I did an education-centric online Q+A was more than three years earlier. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look.
Originally posted at mathcounts.org in March 2010.
How long have you been a MATHCOUNTS coach?
This is my second year coaching the Van Antwerp MATHCOUNTS team.
What is your favorite part about being a MATHCOUNTS coach?
It&amp;rsquo;s great to see my students having a good time with math.</description>

      <title>ssh Passwordlessly</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/post/2013-08-14-ssh-passwordlessly/</link>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re used to ssh-ing into machine B from machine A by typing:
ssh username@B.com
password
Now you wish to ssh from machine A into machine B without having to enter your password. Just follow these steps.
 Create a public/private RSA key pair by issuing the unix command ssh-keygen. Do not enter a passphrase.
 Put the private key on machine A (the machine you wish to ssh from). Usually the best place to put it is in ~/.</description>

      <description>The best way to learn is to teach. It&amp;rsquo;s also, most of the time, the most fun way to learn. And as an added bonus, the person you&amp;rsquo;re teaching learns too.
I strongly believe that you, as someone who has found themselves reading strange blogs on the internet, have a lot to offer the world in the way of teaching. So I want you to teach at scale. Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you Mom and Dad, former Facebook and Twitter interns, my fellow interns here at Khan Academy.</description>

      <description>In this post, clicking the bold word Life will replace it with the bold word Blokus.
Life is simple. It gets more complex over time, but nothing insurmountable. In the beginning, your path is pretty much laid out. You have some control over what directions you go, and these are important decisions. They&amp;rsquo;ll shape your future. They&amp;rsquo;ll change what opportunities you have down the road. But as important as they are, there are relatively few wrong decisions.</description>

      <description>That concludes day one of the TigerTrek. I flew out of Princeton yesterday with a group of 20 to spend the week visiting technology companies, startups and venture capitalists in Silicon Valley. We&amp;rsquo;re going company to company hearing founder&amp;rsquo;s stories, discussing entrepreneurship, and as we do this I am forced to introspect. What do I want to do with my life? How can I make a difference?
My passion is education.</description>

      <description>Check out this video showing what Code@Nights are all about!
Since you’re reading my blog, you should know a little bit about myself. I’m a big fan of Scrabble. I love math, puzzles, and playing tennis. I spend a lot of my would-be-free time on Coursera. And I’m vice chair of Princeton’s ACM Group.
ACM stands for Association for Computing Machinery, but that’s not important. I think that name is silly.</description>
