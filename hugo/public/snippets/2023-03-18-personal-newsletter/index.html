      <p>I write a lot. Every night. Every day. I&rsquo;m constantly writing. And, unlike many of the people I know who similarly take lots of notes, I also regularly read what I write. However, the nature of how I write leaves my writing messy (full of typos) and disjointed (writing on one topic might be scattered across dozens of pages, with lots of unrelated thoughts interspersed between).</p>
<p>About a year ago, I had the idea to hire an editor / writer to help me use all this writing a bit more effectively. My idea at the time was that once a month, I would bundle up everything I&rsquo;d written that month, and send it to my editor. They would read through it, clean up all the typos, and also assemble a monthly newsletter of sorts, just for me. The newsletter would have a section for each major topic in my notes &ndash; each idea that I revisited more than once &ndash; and it would provide a quick recap of my thinking on that topic.</p>
<p>I never hired that editor. Instead, GPT-4 was released, and I implemented this newsletter idea for myself instead.</p>
<h2 id="the-newsletter">The Newsletter</h2>
<p>I now receive, courtesy of Bieber Bot and my messager server, a personalized newsletter twice a week. The newsletter contains a bunch of sections: upcoming plans, things I&rsquo;ve been thinking about, the dominant emotions from the week, etc. Each section is presented in a nice little round-cornered box, with concise text showcasing the highlights from my notes.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a newsletter that I would ever send out to an audience &ndash; it&rsquo;s highly personal! But receiving it in my inbox is a joy. It reminds me of the people I want to reach out to. It reminds me of all the clever little ideas I had throughout the week, that I might not have thought about again for a while. It reminds me of things I&rsquo;d been meaning to buy or do.</p>
<p>Receiving this newsletter helps me connect better with myself by resurfacing all these old ideas I&rsquo;d had throughout the week.</p>
<h2 id="newsletter-features">Newsletter Features</h2>
<p><strong>Questions.</strong> In my first pass at creating the newsletter, I&rsquo;ve given GPT-4 a list of questions to answer using the last 5 days of my notes. The newsletter contains one section per question. Here&rsquo;s the list of questions I started out with, which I expect to refine over time.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are all my open TODOs?</li>
<li>What are all the things I want to buy?</li>
<li>What are all my upcoming plans?</li>
<li>What are some ideas I seem to keep revisiting?</li>
<li>What are my accomplishments from the past week?</li>
<li>List all the people I wanted to reach out to and what I wanted to say to them.</li>
<li>What are the most interesting ideas from my notes?</li>
<li>What are the big recurring themes in my notes?</li>
<li>Are there any things in my notes that didn&rsquo;t make sense to you?</li>
<li>What are the dominant emotions found in the notes?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Digestability.</strong> For each question, GPT-4 prepares concise content that&rsquo;s easy to digest. It arranges the sections in a 2-column layout.</p>
<p><strong>Citing sources.</strong> I&rsquo;ve also asked GPT-4 to include links back to the original notes that it is using to answer the questions. To do this, I include in GPT&rsquo;s view of my notes a unique ID for each note (essentially one ID per block of text). I then have GPT use these ids to cite which notes its using in every sentence that it writes. To me, it&rsquo;s remarkable that this works.</p>
<h2 id="why-are-you-writing-all-this-to-begin-with">Why are you writing all this to begin with?</h2>
<p>One of the personal projects I&rsquo;ve gotten the most value out of is called 
<a href="/projects/go-note-go/">Go Note Go</a>. It&rsquo;s a headless keyboard (a computer keyboard with no screen) that I can write on or speak to, and anything I write on it (or say to it, after pushing the record button), gets transcribed into my notes (for me, this is Roam Research, but Go Note Go supports 7-8 different note-taking systems, so if you want to use it, I&rsquo;m sure wherever you like to keep your writing is fine.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found Go Note Go incredibly rewarding. Whether I&rsquo;m driving somewhere, drifting off to sleep, sitting at my desk, or taking a shower, it&rsquo;s there to help me capture any thoughts I want to remember. Unlike a voice memo or Apple Notes, using it isn&rsquo;t disruptive (to myself or others). Even when just sitting at a desk, I get a great sense of relief turning away from my computer monitor toward Go Note Go to write; it&rsquo;s freeing, and helps me think clearly. I could go on about Go Note Go indefinitely, and if you want to learn more or to build your own, 
<a href="/tags/go-note-go/">you can do so here</a>.</p>
<p>A second personal project that I also use to take notes on the go is my personal Voice Assistant. I have a phone number I can call to either leave myself notes or to talk with GPT. These notes / conversations also end up in my notes in Roam, and hence can end up in my newsletter. I prefer this over a standard voice note-taking app because it works well with car play, so I can use it while I&rsquo;m driving.</p>
<h2 id="building-the-newsletter">Building the Newsletter</h2>
<p>Actually building the newsletter was delightful. Using GPT-4 to process my notes was simple using OpenAI&rsquo;s Python API. Despite this simplicity, I found it faster to have GPT-4 itself write the code that constructs the newsletter than to write it myself.</p>
<p>I also wanted the newsletter to be stylized nicely, not just a wall of text. I haven&rsquo;t done much front-end development work in recent years, but GPT-4 was happy to write the HTML and CSS to make the email exactly as desired (2 columns of rounded corner sections, each with header and content). The email-sending library I was using (a part of my Messager platform) didn&rsquo;t support sending HTML emails though, but GPT-4 had no trouble updating the library to support this.</p>
<p>Overall GPT-4 made building both the automatically-writing-the-newsletter and assisting-me-writing-the-software-that-creates-and-sends-the-newsletter pieces simple and quite fun.
It reminds me of the childhood joy of learning to program; computers are magic, once again.</p>
<h2 id="newsletter-upkeep">Newsletter Upkeep</h2>
<p>I expect that over the next few weeks, as the first installments of the newsletter start showing up in my email, I&rsquo;ll have lots of tweaks and improvements I&rsquo;ll want to make. For one, I look forward to iterating on the list of questions and sections in the newsletter. I&rsquo;m also likely to add some filtering to my notes before they get sent to GPT, to ensure that personal or confidential pieces aren&rsquo;t sent to OpenAI. I&rsquo;m also likely to refine the &ldquo;preamble&rdquo; and prompts GPT sees, so it has more context about topics I write about frequently, and to better align GPT&rsquo;s output with my morning interests and needs.</p>
<p>As an example, I&rsquo;m excited to try having GPT use HTML&rsquo;s summary/details feature to create a cleaner newsletter layout while allowing deep dives by expanding the summaries. Additionally, I&rsquo;m enthusiastic about adding deep linking back into Roam, so that I can quickly access my raw notes from anything in the newsletter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also love to create an experience where simply by clicking on a piece of text in the newsletter, I can start to take the appropriate action on that item. For instance, clicking on a reminder to reach out to someone could open a Gmail draft or Facebook Messenger message draft started by GPT. And If I click on a reminder to buy a backpack, it could open Amazon search results.</p>
<p>For some items in my notes, it might even make sense for GPT to propose or take actions independently. I&rsquo;m keen on exploring this idea and transforming the newsletter into more of a personal assistant experience for myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m confident that I&rsquo;ll have a dozen more ideas and feature requests for myself and for GPT in these coming weeks, and I&rsquo;m delighted to use Go Note Go to keep track of all of them &ndash; only to have them show up in my personal newsletter later in the week. I fully anticipate working with GPT to implement these feature requests to continue improving my newsletter experience.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions-courtesy-of-gpt-4">Conclusions, courtesy of GPT-4</h2>
<p>In conclusion, using GPT-4 to create a personal newsletter has proven to be an effective and enjoyable solution for organizing and revisiting the wealth of ideas and thoughts from daily note-taking. The AI&rsquo;s capabilities in processing and compiling content, as well as its assistance in coding and designing the newsletter, have demonstrated its incredible potential as a developer tool. The resulting personalized newsletter not only helps me in connecting better with myself but also serves as a powerful reminder of my ideas, emotions, and plans that would have otherwise been lost in the chaos of daily life. As GPT-4 continues to evolve, there are endless possibilities for future improvements and applications, making it an invaluable resource for both developers and individuals alike.</p>
