      <title>Sensible units -- Per capita isn&#39;t enough</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-25-sensible-units/</link>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The world population is about 7.9 billion people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The global GDP is about 90 trillion USD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global oil production is about 100 million barrels per day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US federal budget for the 2020 fiscal year was set at $4.79 trillion USD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this snippet we&amp;rsquo;ll take these statements, complete with their large and unwieldy numbers, and turn them into something a bit more tangible. A common (and very good strategy) for making large numbers tangible is to look at their per capita interpretation. Take the number, divide by the relevant population, and you start to get a better picture of what the number means. As we&amp;rsquo;ll see with our first example, this strategy isn&amp;rsquo;t always enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we make the idea of 7.9 billion people more tangible?
Dividing by the world population here would be silly. The population is 1 person per capita. That&amp;rsquo;s not a useful statistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, we can use space and time to make it more tangible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;population-per-unit-space&#34;&gt;Population per Unit Space&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some numbers we may find useful (too big to make immediate sense of for now, but we can deal with that momentarily):
The surface area of Earth is 196.9 million mi².
Of that, 57.51 million mi² is land area, and only about 24.64 million mi² of that is habitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives us a global population density of 312 people per habitable square mile. Still not the most intuitive for two reasons: 1) a square mile is a pretty large area (Manhattan is 23 mi²; San Francisco is 47 mi²) and imagining 312 people scattered across it can be challenging, 2) the population density varies wildly across different regions (population density in Manhattan is 69,468 people per square mile; in San Francisco its 17,246 people per square mile).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can deal with reason (1) pretty simply. 312 people per habitable square mile is 89353 square feet per person. The Manhattan population density equals merely 401 square feet per person. The San Francisco population density equals 1616 square feet per person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s tempting to compare these &amp;ldquo;square feet per person&amp;rdquo; figures to typical apartment sizes in these regions. &amp;ldquo;Four hundred square feet per person,&amp;rdquo; we might be tempted to remark, &amp;ldquo;no wonder apartments in the city are so small!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we do that though, we have to remember two things: First, Manhattan&amp;rsquo;s 23 mi² isn&amp;rsquo;t all apartment space; it also includes public infrastructure like roads and parks, and commercial spaces like stores and offices. Only a fraction of the space is available for living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, redeemingly, Manhattan is built &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt; considerably. For every 10-story building built on 400 square feet of habitable land, we get nearly 4000 square feet of potential living space, not a mere 400.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can turn to 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nyc.gov/html/housing/assets/downloads/pdf/housing_plan.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;New York&amp;rsquo;s 2014 ten-year housing plan&lt;/a&gt; to add more color to these numbers. There were 3.4 million units across New York City in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit of Googling suggests the average apartment size in New York City is 700 square feet. Of course this is going to vary considerably by location and apartment type, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know how much we can trust this estimate. Still, let&amp;rsquo;s work with the number. Using the overall NYC population density of 27,000 people per square mile gives 1032 square feet per person. Meanwhile 3.4 million units × 700 ft²/unit at a population of 8.419 million people gives an apartment-population density of just 276 ft²/person. Dense!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know offhand all the factors I&amp;rsquo;m misrepresenting here. The 3.4 million figure is all housing units, not just apartments. However, the 700 square feet figure is (A) just for apartments, and (B) probably not an average across the whole city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two main messages to take away from this analysis. (1) New York City is population dense and housing is scarce. (2) You can use space to give a clearer picture of population counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;population-per-unit-time&#34;&gt;Population per Unit Time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global population growth rate is about 1.05% per year. That&amp;rsquo;s interesting, but what does it mean? How does that compare with 1.5% or 2%?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our approach to this statement will be to look at the effect of such a growth rate on a more modest size population.
In a city of 100,000 (like Mountain View, or New Haven), a growth rate of 1.05% means the population rises by 1050 people each year (about 1850 births and 700 deaths). That means about 5 babies are born in such a city each day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the growth rate were double (2.1% instead of 1.05%, like it was at its peak in 1962), there would be 10 babies born in a 100,000 person city per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;global-gdp-and-the-us-federal-budget&#34;&gt;Global GDP and the US Federal Budget&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global GDP is $90 trillion USD. Dividing by the global population, we see the global GDP is $11,500 USD per capita.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a lot to unpack there that&amp;rsquo;s out of scope for this snippet. For now it suffices that this new figure is a lot more tangible than the original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performing the same division for the US budget: $4.79 trillion / 328 million people gives a per capita budget of $14,600 USD. Again, there&amp;rsquo;s lots to unpack about this figure out of scope of the snippet, but it immediately makes thinking about budgets a little easier compared with the original figure. Now you can start asking questions like &amp;ldquo;how much should the government be spending on {social security, health care, defense} for &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; individually, and for the average US citizen?&amp;rdquo; Collective budgeting is a weird problem, perhaps something to learn more about for a future snippet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;oil-production&#34;&gt;Oil Production&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final example from my recent time spent learning about oil pricing. Global oil production is about 100 million barrels per day. US oil production is about 10 million barrels per day. How do we make sense of these numbers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per capita figures aren&amp;rsquo;t enough.
I think the useful unit for these figures is &amp;ldquo;gallons per person per month&amp;rdquo;. This allows you to think about how much gas your car holds, and how often you have to fill it up. You can compare that with oil production in your country to get a rough sense of the scale of oil production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globally oil production comes in at 1 barrel per person per 2.6 months. In the US, oil production comes in at 1 barrel per person per month. What&amp;rsquo;s your personal gas consumption rate? How does it compare with the US oil production rate? Are these rates useful to compare?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;recapping-the-original-statements&#34;&gt;Recapping the original statements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we take each of the original statements the way you might find it in a fact book,
and we restate them in more tangible terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Original:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The world population is about 7.9 billion people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are 90000 square feet of habitable land per person globally (1000 ft²/person in NYC, and 14000 ft²/person in a typical suburb.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Original:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The global population growth rate is about 1.05% per year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a city of 100,000 (like Mountain View, or New Haven), the population rises by about 1050 people each year (1850 births, 700 deaths).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s 5 new babies a day in this city on average!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Original:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The global GDP is about $90 trillion USD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The global GDP is $11,500 USD per capita.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Original:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global oil production is about 100 million barrels per day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global oil production comes is 1 barrel per person per 2.6 months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the US, oil production is 1 barrel per person per month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Original:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US federal budget for the 2020 fiscal year was set at $4.79 trillion USD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US federal budget per capita was $14,600 USD in 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>What links here?</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-24-backlinks/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 24 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-24-backlinks/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write about backlinks today but didn&amp;rsquo;t get a chance (except you&amp;rsquo;re reading it, so of course I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; get a chance in the end).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick outline of what I was hoping to write about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backlinks appear in Roam Research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a BrowserFlow flow that uses Google search to produce backlinks for any website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And I saw that either some of Gwern&amp;rsquo;s writing or Less Wrong includes a &amp;ldquo;What links here?&amp;rdquo; section (it wasn&amp;rsquo;t clear to me which of Gwern or LessWrong was providing this functionality)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A backlink on a page X is an indication of what other content links to X. Seeing a list of backlinks can be mildly interesting, and I was curious to see what pages link to my own writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some visibility into this through a couple different mechanisms. This website uses Google Analytics, so I can see where traffic comes from. This provides a decent view into what other websites are linking to my content. I can also see how traffic flows through my own site, which gives a limited view of the links between snippets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second mechanism I can use to see what links to a snippet is Google Search&amp;rsquo;s exact match feature. Searching for a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22https://davidbieber.com/snippets/%22&amp;#43;-site:https://davidbieber.com/snippets/&amp;amp;filter=0&amp;amp;biw=1648&amp;amp;bih=946&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;complete URL in quotes, optionally with &amp;ldquo;-site:urlgoeshereagain&amp;rdquo; in the query to remove links from the same domain,&lt;/a&gt; will show you what websites link to the page of interest. For example, the query 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22davidbieber.com/post/2019-12-29-track-your-life-in-a-spreadsheet/%22&amp;#43;-site:davidbieber.com&amp;amp;filter=0&amp;amp;biw=1648&amp;amp;bih=946&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;davidbieber.com/post/2019-12-29-track-your-life-in-a-spreadsheet/&amp;rdquo; -site:davidbieber.com&lt;/a&gt; shows links to 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/post/2019-12-29-track-your-life-in-a-spreadsheet/&#34;&gt;my Track Your Life in a Spreadsheet blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was toying with the idea of adding some curated backlinks to snippets. Each snippet would show what other snippets reference it, as well as selected pages from around the web that reference it. Of course, there aren&amp;rsquo;t really pages around the web that reference my snippets, so this idea is moot at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Incomplete snippets</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-23-incomplete-snippets/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-23-incomplete-snippets/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday and two days ago I started writing 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-22-sensible-units&#34;&gt;a snippet called &amp;ldquo;sensible units &amp;ndash; per capita isn&amp;rsquo;t enough&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. In this snippet I take statements with big numbers and rewrite them to make them more intuitive. For example &amp;ldquo;The global population growth rate is about 1.05% per year.&amp;rdquo; becomes &amp;ldquo;In a city of 100,000 (like Mountain View, or New Haven), the population rises by about 1050 people each year (1850 births, 700 deaths). That&amp;rsquo;s 5 new babies a day in this city on average!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t finish the snippet though. While I hope to finish the snippet and publish it this weekend, this experience also made me think about how to publish incomplete snippets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had other incomplete snippets over the years. Peer Learning Group was initially an incomplete snippet back in July 2020, which I never published. Eventually (in January 2021) I decided to launch PLG without &amp;ldquo;finishing&amp;rdquo; the idea as I&amp;rsquo;d originally intended. The original idea was going to rely more heavily on automation and in principle could scale well. The actual idea I went with had a fair bit of manual coordination work, but was definitely worthwhile (in part because it actually happened!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My idea for publishing incomplete snippets is: to start, simply publish the snippet with a label &amp;ldquo;incomplete&amp;rdquo; in the title. Then, if I decide to continue the snippet, I will make a copy of the incomplete snippet, and change the date. If I finish it, I will remove incomplete from the title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I have a complete version of the snippet (which might sometimes never happen), I can link from the complete version to all the incomplete versions that preceded it. I may also remove the incomplete snippets from the main snippets index once a complete version is available. Or in that main index I may make the main link go to the complete version, with a smaller link that goes to the incomplete version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea requires a bit of development, but in the spirit of the idea itself, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll start publishing incomplete snippets even while the incomplete-snippet-publication-idea is itself incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sensible units -- Per capita isn&#39;t enough (incomplete)</title>

      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is an 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-23-incomplete-snippets/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;incomplete&lt;/strong&gt; snippet&lt;/a&gt;. If I complete it, I&amp;rsquo;ll add a link to the completed snippet here. Update: 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-25-sensible-units&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the finished version.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The world population is about 7.9 billion people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The global GDP is about 90 trillion USD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global oil production is about 100 million barrels per day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US federal budget for the 2020 fiscal year was set at $4.79 trillion USD.&lt;/li&gt;

As we&amp;rsquo;ll see with our first example, this strategy isn&amp;rsquo;t always enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we make 7.7 billion people more tangible?

&lt;p&gt;Instead, we can use space and time to make it more tangible.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you Google &amp;ldquo;Python set intersection&amp;rdquo;, you get a number of results about the &lt;code&gt;set.intersection&lt;/code&gt; function. It isn&amp;rsquo;t until the fourth result that you reach a page mentioning Python&amp;rsquo;s convenient syntax for performing set operations. This was surprising to me, hence this snippet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background-collections-in-python&#34;&gt;Background: Collections in Python&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python has a few primitive collection types: tuples, lists, dictionaries (aka dicts), and sets. Use parenthesis to create a tuple &lt;code&gt;(1, 2, 3)&lt;/code&gt;, square brackets to create a list &lt;code&gt;[4, 5, 6]&lt;/code&gt;, and squirrelly brackets to create a dict or set: &lt;code&gt;{7: 8, 9: 10}&lt;/code&gt; makes a dict and &lt;code&gt;{11, 12, 13}&lt;/code&gt; makes a set. Just like a set in mathematics, a set in Python is an &lt;strong&gt;unordered&lt;/strong&gt; collection of &lt;strong&gt;distinct&lt;/strong&gt; elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;convenient-syntax&#34;&gt;Convenient Syntax&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve constructed a set, the following operations allow you to perform set operations on it with clean concise syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;| for union.
&amp;amp; for intersection.
– for difference
^ for symmetric difference
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;operation-examples&#34;&gt;Operation Examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;# Example 1: Disjoint sets (sets that have no elements in common)
{1, 2, 3} | {4, 5, 6} == {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
{1, 2, 3} &amp;amp; {4, 5, 6} == set()
{1, 2, 3} - {4, 5, 6} == {1, 2, 3}
{1, 2, 3} ^ {4, 5, 6} == {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice how we cannot write &lt;code&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt; to create an empty set. That would create an empty dict. Instead we write &lt;code&gt;set()&lt;/code&gt;. (You can also write &lt;code&gt;tuple()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;list()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;dict()&lt;/code&gt; to create empty tuples, lists, or dicts.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;# Example 2: Overlapping sets
{&#39;red&#39;, &#39;green&#39;, &#39;blue&#39;} | {&#39;blue&#39;, &#39;yellow&#39;} == {&#39;red&#39;, &#39;green&#39;, &#39;blue&#39;, &#39;yellow&#39;}
{&#39;red&#39;, &#39;green&#39;, &#39;blue&#39;} &amp;amp; {&#39;blue&#39;, &#39;yellow&#39;} == {&#39;blue&#39;}
{&#39;red&#39;, &#39;green&#39;, &#39;blue&#39;} - {&#39;blue&#39;, &#39;yellow&#39;} == {&#39;red&#39;, &#39;green&#39;}
{&#39;red&#39;, &#39;green&#39;, &#39;blue&#39;} ^ {&#39;blue&#39;, &#39;yellow&#39;} == {&#39;red&#39;, &#39;yellow&#39;, &#39;green&#39;}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;set-augment-operations&#34;&gt;Set augment operations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the operations &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt; has a corresponding &amp;ldquo;augment&amp;rdquo; operation: &lt;code&gt;|=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-=&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;^=&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you use an augment operation, the operation is applied and the result is assigned back to the variable on the left hand side of the operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of how to use these operations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;# Example 3: Set augment operations (|=, &amp;amp;=, -=, and ^=)
x = {1, 2, 3}
x |= {3, 4, 5}
print(x)  # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
x &amp;amp;= {4, 5, 6}
print(x)  # {4, 5}
x -= {5, 6, 7}
print(x)  # {4}
x ^= {6, 7, 8}
print(x)  # {4, 6, 7, 8}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;set-elements-must-be-hashable&#34;&gt;Set elements must be hashable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, sets can contain any elements as long as they are hashable. So, a set can contain numbers, strings, and bools. A set can also contain tuples, but not lists or dicts or other sets. If you want a set to contain a dict or another set, you can use a &amp;ldquo;frozendict&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;frozenset&amp;rdquo;, which are immutable hashable versions of dicts and sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To check if an object &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is hashable, you can run &lt;code&gt;hash(x)&lt;/code&gt;. This will return the hash of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; if &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; can be hashed, and will raise a TypeError otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Virtual table tennis coaching</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-18-virtual-table-tennis-coaching/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 18 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-18-virtual-table-tennis-coaching/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the last few weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing virtual reality table tennis quite a lot. It&amp;rsquo;s competitive; some highly ranked real-life table tennis players from around the world play this game. My ranking has been going up: my ELO recently reached 2000+, bringing me (at least temporarily) into the top 1500 ranked players online (out of upwards of 440,000 players total.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, I&amp;rsquo;d like to make my number go up. So I practice. I play ranked and unranked games against people around the world. I practice against AI opponents. I use the virtual  ball machine. And I watch YouTube videos on how to hit the strokes appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I haven&amp;rsquo;t done though is get a coach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few people have started offering in game virtual reality table tennis coaching. I think this is incredible. The coach and player play at the table simultaneously. They can stand on the same side of the table or opposite each other. They can use a ball machine together or hit with one another. They can discuss table tennis and do exercises together all in game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m interested in giving virtual lessons a try. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how good I&amp;rsquo;d be at receiving coaching though, and this is something I&amp;rsquo;d like to improve at. What makes for a good coach/player relationship? Players need psychological safety. Coaches need to be observant and knowledgeable. Players need to want to improve and ask good questions. Players need to be receptive to the suggestions of the coach. Players need to trust that the coach is focusing on the important aspects of play, so they can focus on the drill at hand. Coaches need to establish this trust. Players have to put in the time to improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table tennis quest game is still under active development, and the features that make coaching possible are still young. As I understand it, there aren&amp;rsquo;t special coaching features &amp;ndash; there&amp;rsquo;s just the capability for two people to use around a table optionally with a ball machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose the game developers were to add features to improve the coaching experience. What features would be essential? (1) Record and replay hits from a game or practice (2) Track stats during practice (3) Coach multiple people simultaneously across multiple tables (4) Mix and match replays&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;record-and-replay&#34;&gt;Record and Replay&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two reasons to want to record and replay hits from a game or practice. One is to learn to defend against them. Say you play against an opponent with a powerful serve or forehand smash. By recording and replaying their attack you can practice defending against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason to record and replay is to mimic or correct a shot. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you tend to hit your backhand loops into the net. It would be useful to replay the hit as a &amp;ldquo;ghost&amp;rdquo; that you can overlay your real paddle against. In this way you can make subtle adjustments in order to improve this shot. Similarly, you can take the powerful serve or forehand smash from the previous example and learn to mimic it by replaying it repeatedly and following along the motions with your own paddle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;track-stats-during-practice&#34;&gt;Track stats during practice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An essential tool for self improvement is numbers that go up: ELO ratings, win counts, balls returned, etc. Giving the ball machine the capability of tracking how many balls you return successfully (where &amp;ldquo;success&amp;rdquo; is something you can define, such as hitting a certain region of the table, perhaps with a certain minimum speed or spin) and how many you miss creates a new metric to improve. And once there&amp;rsquo;s a metric to improve, putting in the time to improve it becomes all the more satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d love if the game could track a metric like this over time. This feature would pair especially well with the next one, allowing a coach to coach multiple people simultaneously, because it would give the coach quick visibility into the progress of the players towards their goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;coaching-multiple-people-across-multiple-tables&#34;&gt;Coaching multiple people across multiple tables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently coaching is a one on one affair. This is virtual reality though, so the potential for tools for coaching go way beyond what&amp;rsquo;s possible in the real world. A simple place to start is allowing the coach to simultaneously coach multiple people. The coach would do this by having all their students at various tables. The coach could have a multi-table view, where they can monitor all tables at once. Then, through VR magic the coach can quickly teleport to any of the tables to provide individual instruction. The coach can speak with players one on one, or to the whole group simultaneously. Similarly, the coach can set the ball machine settings for individual players or for the whole group. And the coach can pair off players to hit together or play matches or do exercises as they deem appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ball replay feature is of course also essential in this setting. If the coach observes a particularly good shot on any of the tables, they can capture this and replay it for all the players. Everyone can practice returning this one shot, whether it&amp;rsquo;s a smash, loop, or lob, to improve their table tennis game together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mixing-and-matching-replays&#34;&gt;Mixing and matching replays&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The record and replay feature is going to be essential to the future of practice. Replaying a single ball over and over is useful, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t capture the dynamic nature of table tennis. So, one useful feature to pair with replaying a shot is the ability to add variance to the shot. In the original recording, the smash has X speed and Y spin and hits precisely position Z. In the replays, all these values can be perturbed slightly to practice variations on the theme. Also, being able to build sequences of replay shots, much in the way you can turn on multiple ball machine settings today, would be a welcome addition for practicing in game situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know which of these the game developers have planned. And of those that they have planned (they seem to have &lt;strong&gt;everything&lt;/strong&gt; planned), I wonder which are planned first. Once I&amp;rsquo;ve had my first coaching session, I&amp;rsquo;m sure my feature requests will only grow. Looking forward to it all. 🏓&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Resuming snippet writing?</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-17-resuming-snippet-writing/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-17-resuming-snippet-writing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;About two month ago I encountered a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-21-snippets-dry-spell/&#34;&gt;snippets dry spell&lt;/a&gt;. At the time I didn&amp;rsquo;t foresee writing snippets at the same rate I had been leading up to that point. Sure enough, over the two months that followed I only wrote a handful of snippets. March saw two simultaneous Peer Learning Groups, and April lead into a period of intense virtual ping pong playing and lots of real-life hiking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wrapped up the Peer Learning Groups, a largely asynchronous low-commitment activity, with a virtual synchronous meet-up and coworking session. During these I produced these two snippets about what I learned for my PLG sessions: one on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-15-oil-pricing/&#34;&gt;Laser Eye Surgery&lt;/a&gt;, one on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-15-oil-pricing/&#34;&gt;Oil Pricing&lt;/a&gt;. I think this could be the trigger that brings me back into the pattern of writing snippets again, though I&amp;rsquo;m not certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting out to write snippets once more, I have a handful of half-baked ideas about what to write about: sleep, ping pong, virtual reality, hiking, the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-21-snippets-dry-spell/&#34;&gt;list of ideas from February&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, yet more snippets about Browserflow and Roam Research, machine learning research, PLG and other online learning ideas, and pandemic coping are all on my list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I sat down today to pen a snippet, I initially thought I would write about my ideas for using virtual reality table tennis for group coaching sessions. It felt funny though; I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure why I was writing it. Was snippets a place to collect good ideas I may want to share with people in the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This snippet is me taking a moment to reflect on why I write snippets, to reload my old reasoning back into memory, and to see if it still makes sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a few early reasons. Learning to communicate was a big one early on. Avoiding the addicting nature of social media was part of why I chose to write here, rather than on another platform. Feeling like I was writing for no audience, and the freedoms and desires that I found came with that, was a bigger reason for continuing on this platform rather than another. All of these continue to ring true, though there is one key way in which my writing deviates from its stated purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I set out to get better at communicating, one of my motivations was for communicating research. I&amp;rsquo;ve hardly written about my research at all! I don&amp;rsquo;t want to make a big change here; I like the type of topic I tend to select for snippets, and I like the expectation that I&amp;rsquo;ve set for myself that I can write about anything, with the bar set extremely low. That said, I will make a small mental adjustment, and add to my internal Potential Topics List writing about my published research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with this snippet, I hope and intend that I am resuming somewhat more frequent writing. This is a non-promise, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-08-biking-in-the-morning/&#34;&gt;a mere &amp;ldquo;aspirational intent&amp;rdquo; like the one I made about biking back in October&lt;/a&gt;. That one worked out though; I continued biking regularly well into the cold season, so I&amp;rsquo;m optimistic that this one will pan out positively as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;

      <title>Eleven: Table Tennis VR</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-16-table-tennis-vr/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-16-table-tennis-vr/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Adriana and I recently acquired a VR headset (an Oculus Quest 2), and I bought the game &amp;ldquo;Eleven: Table Tennis VR&amp;rdquo;.
My mind is blown. It&amp;rsquo;s like having a ping pong table that fits in your hands. You can bring it anywhere; it travels well. And if you do, you not only have everything you need to play ping pong (a table, paddles, $\infty$ balls, etc.) you also have thousands of people of every possible skill level always ready and eager to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you enter the game, it&amp;rsquo;s like standing at a ping pong table. Toss the ball from one hand, hit it with the paddle in the other. Simple. The physics is realistic. Lag, when present, is handled pretty well. When you hit the ball into the net, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to reach over and pick it up. When you hit the ball out, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to walk over and pick it up. You have infinity balls, and can play against AI opponents with infinity patience. You can play against real people too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m beyond excited by this game. Being able to play ping pong with anyone around the world from the comfort of my own home is a science fiction future turned reality I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize I was missing. If you have the game &amp;ndash; it works on all sorts of different VR systems with cross-system play handled just fine &amp;ndash; do let me know. I would love to say hi over a game of table tennis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect multiple future snippets will contain musings about directions the game could go in, and I very much looking forward to seeing the game develop. 🏓&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learning about Oil Pricing</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-15-oil-pricing/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-15-oil-pricing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the March 2021 Climate Change Peer Learning Group, I spent a couple of hours learning about Oil Pricing. This proved far too large a topic to cover in the allotted time, far more so than for any of the other topics I&amp;rsquo;ve studied in a PLG before. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;learning-trajectory&#34;&gt;Learning Trajectory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with Wikipedia and some assorted Googling to get the basics of crude oil, shale, natural gas, to get an idea for their rough production levels around the world, and to learn a bit of history about OPEC. Eventually, I landed on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.e-education.psu.edu/eme801/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this course from PennState: &lt;strong&gt;Energy Markets, Policy, and Regulation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course is an excellent resource, and I spent about an hour going through the first lesson (of 12), which is about the global market for crude oil. It was well written, interesting, and provided a good not-too-heavy mix of history, geopolitics, and economics to bring me up to speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future lessons promise to cover the markets for refined petroleum products, the markets for natural gas, and then further topics on natural gas, electricity, energy regulations, challenges with adopting renewables, and a number of related econ and finance topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want a thorough introduction to the topic, check out 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.e-education.psu.edu/eme801/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;the course&lt;/a&gt;.
If you instead want a lighter more enjoyable exploration of the topic, check out 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/08/26/491342091/planet-money-buys-oil&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Planet Money Buys Oil&lt;/a&gt;, a 20-minute episode of NPR&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Planet Money&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;understanding-oil&#34;&gt;Understanding Oil&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s crude oil, shale oil, and natural gas. Crude oil is found at a depth of about 6000 ft, and requires the most refining of the three to be useful. Shale oil is found at a depth of about 9000 ft. Natural gas is primarily methane, and requires the least work of the three to refine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within each of these main categories of oil, there is a large numbers of kinds of oil. Take a look at the futures and indexes listed 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://oilprice.com/oil-price-charts/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;on these oil price charts&lt;/a&gt; to get a sense for how many different kinds of oil trade every day. The two at the top of the charts, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent, are the most important, as those two serve as benchmark oil prices for the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes an oil higher or lower quality? Two important dimensions are its sulfur content, and its viscosity. Oils low in sulfur are said to be &amp;ldquo;sweet&amp;rdquo;, while those high in sulfur are termed &amp;ldquo;sour&amp;rdquo;. The lower the sulfur content, the higher quality the oil. Viscosity of crude oil is measured on the API (&amp;ldquo;American Petroleum Institute&amp;rdquo;) gravity scale. Low viscosity oils are called &amp;ldquo;light&amp;rdquo;, and high viscosity oils are called &amp;ldquo;heavy&amp;rdquo;, with lower viscosity being preferable and more valuable than higher viscosity oils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTI is a light sweet oil representative of the US market. Brent is a blend of light sweet crude oils from the North Sea, with just slightly higher levels of sulfur than WTI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fplayground%2F-WMfNd5Pis.png?alt=media&amp;amp;token=f9149939-7126-438b-8487-4de6a601529c&#34; alt=&#34;Details about several different oil blends around the world.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;oil-production-levels&#34;&gt;Oil Production Levels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US, Russian, and Saudi Arabia all producing near peak rates 9 to 11 million barrels per day.
In the US, that works out to about 1 barrel per person per month.
In the Russia, production is about 2 barrels per person per month.
And in Saudi Arabia, production is about 10 barrels per person per month.
(The differences here come from differences in the nations&#39; populations, not from their oil production levels, which are all the same order of magnitude.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like thinking about production in terms of barrels per person per month because you get nice tangible values that you can compare to your own oil usage. How often do you get gas for your car? How long does it take you to go through a barrel of oil yourself? Far more than a month, I&amp;rsquo;m sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-wee-bit-of-history&#34;&gt;A Wee Bit of History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were important oil embargos in 1973 and 1979. I&amp;rsquo;ll summarize what I read about briefly here, but I recommend reading through 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.e-education.psu.edu/eme801/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;the course&amp;rsquo;s text&lt;/a&gt; rather than this short summary.
In 1973: an unwarranted energy scare leads to the Arab oil embargo. The Middle East countries announce a 5% production cut per month as a reaction to the Yom Kippur war between Egypt and Israel. Though they announced a 5% decrease in production, in practice decreased production less than 1%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main takeaway from this event: Cartel coordination is hard! Each country still had an individual profit motive, which prevented the embargo participants from carrying out their stated embargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1979 embargo: An Iranian worker strike lead to oil prices rising. Again, this was mostly due to speculation not an actual production decrease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main takeaways from these two events:  Fear of control due to OPEC is just as powerful (perhaps more so) as the actual control exerted by OPEC. More recently, fear of geopolitical instability in the Middle East and Africa has a similar effect. It&amp;rsquo;s abundantly clear there is so much important history and geopolitics that I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten to read about yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-notes&#34;&gt;My Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is lots more from the PennState course. I&amp;rsquo;ll recommend it one last time for anyone who wants to dive deeper into the subject. This is a massive topic and I spent a little under two hours reading about it. So, there&amp;rsquo;s much more to learn! To see what else I encountered in my brief foray into the topic, have a look at

      <title>Learning about LASIK</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-08-laser-eye-surgery/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-08-laser-eye-surgery/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My topic for the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-03-11-peer-learning-group-topics/&#34;&gt;March 2021 Peer Learning Group&lt;/a&gt; was &amp;ldquo;Laser Eye Surgery.&amp;rdquo; So, I spent an hour learning about LASIK. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-name-lasik&#34;&gt;The name &amp;ldquo;LASIK&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LASIK stands for Laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lasers&lt;/strong&gt;, which you&amp;rsquo;re probably familiar, emit high power beams of light. This is useful for laser eye surgery because a computer-guided laser can be used to precisely burn away pieces of your cornea in order to reshape your eye and correct your vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In situ&lt;/strong&gt; is Latin for &amp;ldquo;on site&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;in position&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keratomileusis&lt;/strong&gt; comes from the Greek &lt;em&gt;κέρας&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;kéras&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;horn&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;σμίλευσις&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;smileusis&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;carving&lt;/em&gt;, and refers to the reshaping of the cornea that is central to LASIK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-does-lasik-work&#34;&gt;How does LASIK work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laser eye surgery uses a laser to reshape the cornea in your eye. By reshaping the cornea, it changes how your eye refracts light. And if done correctly (as it usually is!), this improves your vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To access the cornea, the eye surgeon first cuts a flap into the surface of the cornea. This allows the surgeon to move that part of the cornea out of the way, exposing the remainder of the cornea. Once the flap is lifted, the surgeon uses a laser to reshape the cornea. Finally, the flap is returned to its original position and allowed to heal naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we summarize the process of LASIK with three steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut a flap into the cornea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reshape the cornea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reposition the flap to heal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s go through the steps one by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-cutting-a-flap-into-the-cornea&#34;&gt;1. Cutting a flap into the cornea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main approaches used for cutting this initial flap into the cornea: using a microkeratome or a femtosecond laser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A microkeratome is not a laser: it&amp;rsquo;s a mechanical device, basically a knife. That&amp;rsquo;s right, with the microkeratome approach the surgeon is more-or-less taking a knife to your eye.
It&amp;rsquo;s a special knife though, designed to create the micron-thin slip in the cornea needed to prepare your eye for LASIK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second approach is the femtosecond laser, so called because its pulses last a few femtoseconds. That&amp;rsquo;s less than a picosecond! ($1\text{ fs} = 10^{-15}\text{ s}$)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flap we&amp;rsquo;re making here is really thin, measuring just 83 to 200 micrometers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4089871/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;This paper&lt;/a&gt; discusses common considerations in management and complications of the flap-cutting step in femtosecond laser LASIK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the possible complications? The paper lists &amp;ldquo;incomplete or partial flaps, free flaps, buttonholes, and small irregular flaps&amp;rdquo; as possible complications when using a microkeratome. The paper also describes the complications as &amp;ldquo;plaguing refractive surgeons&amp;rdquo; rather than plaguing the patients, which I think may be misdirected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My understanding is that femtosecond laser LASIK was steadily on the rise in 2008, and perhaps at this point is the standard approach to LASIK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper linked above lists these advantages of femtosecond LASIK over microkeratome LASIK: flap thickness reproducibility, wavefront measurements, stromal bed quality, and biomechanical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what approach to cutting the flap the surgeon uses, this step takes just a couple of seconds. In fact, the whole procedure is rather short, lasting no more than a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-reshaping-the-cornea&#34;&gt;2. Reshaping the cornea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the central step of LASIK! This is the step that can actually improve your vision. A computer-guided excimer laser removes part of the cornea, reshaping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;computer-guided excimer laser&amp;rdquo;? It&amp;rsquo;s a powerful and precise laser capable of removing as little as 0.25 microns of tissue at a time. The &amp;ldquo;computer-guided&amp;rdquo; part of the laser uses eye-tracking to adjust where it cuts in response to any eye-movements you make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the perks of using a computer-guided laser is that it can respond quickly to any eye or head movements you make. If you move a little, it adjusts where it cuts. If you move too much, it shuts off the laser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia informs me that the term &amp;ldquo;excimer&amp;rdquo; in excimer laser is a bit of a misnomer, and that &amp;ldquo;exciplex&amp;rdquo; would be more correct. An exciplex is an &lt;em&gt;excited complex&lt;/em&gt;, in our case an excited noble gas halide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this step of LASIK, the excimer laser adjusts the shape of the cornea in order to correct the patient&amp;rsquo;s vision. Reshaping the cornea is an effective technique for correcting nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearsightedness occurs when the shape of your eye causes light to refract incorrectly such that images are focused in front of your retina, rather than directly &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; your retina. Similarly, farsightedness occurs when your the shape of your eye causes the image to focus behind your retina. Vision impairments like these are perfect candidates for fixing with LASIK, since they can be remedied simply by modifying the shape of your cornea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To correct nearsightedness, the excimer laser is used to flatten the cornea. This causes incoming light to refract less, such that the focal point is moved further back, toward your retina. For farsightedness, the laser makes the cornea steeper, bringing the focal point forward in your eye. For an astigmatism, it aims to smooth the cornea into a more symmetrical shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-repositioning-the-flap-to-heal&#34;&gt;3. Repositioning the flap to heal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the cornea has been reshaped, the surgeon repositions the flap over the cornea. This acts as a natural bandage, and the cornea heals quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-anesthesia-used&#34;&gt;Is anesthesia used?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, eye numbing drops are given. You&amp;rsquo;re awake the whole time though. If you move a little, the computer-guidance will account for it. If you move too much, the laser will shut off automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;risks&#34;&gt;Risks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loss of vision is very rare. Dry eyes is common. Temporary vision problems like glare are common too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the complete list of risks I found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dry eyes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glare, halos, double vision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Undercorrections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overcorrections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astigmatism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flap problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vision loss or changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For myself, I would (naively) be primarily worried about regression. That said, it does seem to be an uncommon issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;costs&#34;&gt;Costs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LASIK is not usually covered by insurance, as it is typically considered elective surgery. The cost of LASIK is reported to be between $\text{\$1,000}$ and $\text{\$3,000}$ per eye. 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vsp.com/eyewear-wellness/lasik-glasses-lenses/lasik-eye-surgery-cost&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;VSP has this page&lt;/a&gt; with a list of questions you should ask to understand exactly what is included in the cost of LASIK (Pre- and post- operative care? Follow-up procedures if fine-tuning is needed? One eye or two?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;open-questions&#34;&gt;Open questions:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind I only spent about an hour researching LASIK. There are many questions I am not qualified to answer. Here are some of the questions I still have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How common are each of the risks?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How is the flap moved out of the way? How is it repositioned?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do the medical devices and surgery actually look like?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For myself, I would be concerned that my vision changes too quickly. Is there a way to measure this to verify or invalidate this concern?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;peer-learning-group&#34;&gt;Peer Learning Group&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote up this topic at the conclusion to the March 2021 Peer Learning Group. We&amp;rsquo;re in between Peer Learning Groups right now.

      <title>Simplest Possible Case of the Efficient Minds Hypothesis Failing</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-03-10-efficient-minds-hypothesis-failing/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-03-10-efficient-minds-hypothesis-failing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Suppose you know $A$, and you know $A \to B$. Conventional wisdom suggests you also know $B$. However, this is not necessarily true. Conventional wisdom has incorrectly assumed the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-03-04-the-efficient-minds-hypothesis/&#34;&gt;Efficient Minds Hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why isn&amp;rsquo;t this true? Isn&amp;rsquo;t it the first thing you&amp;rsquo;re taught in an Introductory Logic course? The reason is that it takes time and attention to conclude $B$ given that you know (1) $A$ and (2) $A \to B$. Whether or not you&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that you know both (1) and (2) and made the connection between them isn&amp;rsquo;t specified, so we can&amp;rsquo;t conclude that you&amp;rsquo;ve reached the conclusion $B$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might object &amp;ldquo;well if &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; knew $A$ and $A \to B$, I would conclude $B$ immediately. It&amp;rsquo;s obvious.&amp;rdquo; To this I would reply &amp;ldquo;not so fast &amp;ndash; no pun intended,&amp;rdquo; while clearly intending the pun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might know thousands of facts $P_1, \cdots, P_{9000}$. Noticing that two of them collectively have the form (1) $A$ and (2) $A \to B$ is a bit like finding a needle in a haystack; there are $9000^2$ fact pairs in that set to consider. While finding the good pairs can sometimes be fast, it&amp;rsquo;s never immediate and sometimes doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if you know (1) $A$ and (2) $B$, you still may not know $A\text{ and }B$. And if you know just (1) $A$, you may not realize $A\text{ or }B$. Each of these conclusions requires time and attention to reach, even if classical first order logic tells us the conclusions are trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That we are often able to perform inference really quickly is a remarkable thing, attributable to our brain&amp;rsquo;s natural but imperfect tendency to index information by its important properties. While our brains are remarkable, they are not perfectly efficient, and we should behoove ourselves not to fall prey to the fallacy of the Efficient Minds Hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Healthy Games Inter-company Compact</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-03-08-healthy-games-inter-company-compact/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-03-08-healthy-games-inter-company-compact/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This snippet is a silly, currently unworkable, but in my opinion still worthwhile idea to improve the healthiness of video games. Mobile games today are in an arms race. Make your game more addicting, and your game becomes more profitable. More addicting is not the same as more fun. They may be correlated, but the incentives of video game companies are not wholly aligned with the incentives of the players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it an &amp;ldquo;arms race&amp;rdquo;? There&amp;rsquo;s limited mindshare. Making your game addicting claims more of this mindshare. More engaging games are more profitable. And there&amp;rsquo;s no easy way for a game company to disentangle unhealthy addictive engagement from increased engagement due to increased quality of the game (is this true? will ponder&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers of these games will A/B test mechanisms and designs and select those that maximize engagement. This isn&amp;rsquo;t unique to video games; it applies to social media and advertising as well, but we&amp;rsquo;ll focus on video games for this snippet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter the &amp;ldquo;Healthy Games Inter-company Compact&amp;rdquo;. This is a hypothetical future agreement between all the video game companies. The &amp;ldquo;Healthy Games Inter-company Compact&amp;rdquo; (HGIC for short) states that once 100% of game companies agree to the compact, all video games will simultaneously reduce the addictiveness of their games by 20% (the specific number&amp;rsquo;s not central to the idea). Signing the agreement does nothing if not all video game companies have signed. Only once all such companies are signed the agreement does it come into effect. At that point, the agreement comes into effect for all companies at once, and all games are simultaneously made less addicting. (This idea is inspired by the real 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Popular Vote Interstate Compact&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many reasons why this can&amp;rsquo;t work in practice. In the spirit of taking silly ideas seriously, let&amp;rsquo;s go through those reasons, and perhaps we&amp;rsquo;ll find some of them weaker than first appearance might suggest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first reason it can&amp;rsquo;t work is that 100% of video game companies agreeing to &amp;ldquo;mutual disarmament&amp;rdquo; would be such an extraordinary feat. 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_industry#Scope&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; estimates that in the US alone there are 2,300 development companies and over 525 publishing companies. What would a consortium of all video game companies even look like? Why would 10% of companies agree to this compact, let alone 100%? A few could agree to it out of genuine interest in the health of their addiction-prone players. A few others could agree to it if it makes strategic sense for them. Getting to 10% seems farfetched, 100% fantastical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, even if all the current video game companies did agree, the market is such that a new player could enter the video game industry at any time, disregarding the compact. This HGIC would need to be legislation, not just an inter-company compact, for it to apply to new entrants. This is something I am doubtful I would support, even though the HGIC is my idea. It would proabably even take considerable effort to make a legislative version of the HGIC constitutional! (Is game mechanism design a protected form of speech?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, even if all current video game companies signed the HGIC, acted in good faith, and even if there were no possibility of new entrants, there still remain the difficult questions of how to measure the reduction in unhealthy addictiveness of games. As a strawman, the HGIC could specify a metric, say play-time per player, and all companies would reduce their play-time per player by an agreed upon percent. I&amp;rsquo;ll readily acknowledge this sounds ridiculous; it could mean ruining the fun of some games, not making them healthier! As a second strawman, the HGIC could specify specific game mechanics and how to adjust them. E.g. it would specify that count-down timers need to be shortened by X% (does that even help?), non-deterministic rewards need to be made Y% more deterministic, etc. I&amp;rsquo;ll readily acknowledge this strawman is ridiculous too; there are likely too many possible game mechanics for an agreement of this form to be manageable to produce. Finding an equivalent reduction in addictiveness across all games is impossible because games are simply too varied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourthly and finally, &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve shared this idea with so far (three people in total) have disagreed with the premise, that the addicting nature of video games is a negative thing, and that reducing it is desirable. This is a real surprise to me. I thought it was generally accepted that the tactics employed by FarmVille, CandyCrush, Covet, and the like are deliberative exploitative and addictive, designed through experimentation to maximize engagement and profit, and that this is a negative aspect of the games. I suppose I was wrong about this (the generally accepted part, that is). Guess I need to expand my bubble.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now have four solid reasons that the Healthy Games Inter-company Compact could never come into effect. I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are a dozen more. It&amp;rsquo;s nevertheless nice to imagine a world in which a few companies draft and sign the compact, initially thinking it will never come into effect. And then, over time, more companies are drawn to the idea of improving the health of their addiction-prone customers, until eventually the industry enacts and broadly follows guidelines for healthy game development. I think that&amp;rsquo;s a world to aspire to, albeit unrealistic. So while the HGIC in all likelihood won&amp;rsquo;t work, perhaps there&amp;rsquo;s another path there.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Efficient Minds Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-03-04-the-efficient-minds-hypothesis/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Mar 2021 13:36:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-03-04-the-efficient-minds-hypothesis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Efficient Minds Hypothesis&amp;rdquo; states that a person is able to reach whatever conclusions they are able to reach in a small finite amount of time. Unless new information is presented, after that small duration no new conclusions will be reached. Stated more succinctly, the Efficient Minds Hypothesis states that &amp;ldquo;thinking is near-instantaneous.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is of course, preposterous. However, when it is not named and stated so explicitly, believing the EMH is an easy trap to fall into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are negative consequences to believing the EMH, even implicitly or subconsciously. It can lead to asking fewer questions. It can lead to scheduling less time for planning and Great Thoughts, and spending too large a proportion of your time on building and chasing short-term goals. It can lead to too much self-reliance, and a reluctance to delegate or share the burden of a project with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Efficient Minds Hypothesis is mainly a strawman that I don&amp;rsquo;t think many people would claim to believe outright, I do think it&amp;rsquo;s an idea that people (at least myself) sometimes believe implicitly. Making it explicit helps to make its status as a fallacy clearer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write about the Efficient Minds Hypothesis from personal experience. While I don&amp;rsquo;t consciously believe the EMH (as I stated above, I think it&amp;rsquo;s preposterous), I find that beneath the surface of my thoughts I often do believe it, and can act or think accordingly. Being surrounded by creative intelligent people at work, spending every day thinking about challenging problems, the falsity of the EMH (at least with respect to my own mind), has been crystal clear day after day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its falsity is most clear when a colleague suggests a solution to a problem that I have that I have not seen. The solution feels like something simple enough to arrive at quickly given my experience, but it is apparently not, for it&amp;rsquo;s a solution I did not foresee. On N occasions it has even been the case that I have not even begun to properly start thinking about the problem when a colleague presents the solution, perhaps because there are many possible problems to attend to, and selecting where to place one&amp;rsquo;s attention is a problem in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the EMH, the idea that you can present a problem to a colleague without first having given it the small finite first attempt doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense. If EMH were true, you would present only problems that you cannot yourself solve to your colleagues. In the time it takes to present a problem, you would have attempted solving it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maxims of &amp;ldquo;bring me solutions, not problems&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t come to me until you&amp;rsquo;ve worked this out as much as you can on your own&amp;rdquo; are weakened by the lack of an EMH too. Sometimes you need to engage other minds simply to parallelize computation, not because one mind alone cannot solve something. The benefits of multiple minds go beyond parallelization though. Freshness and specialization are two principles that make a collaboration more than the sum of its parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why believe the EMH at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When young, when working on easier problems, when you can anticipate what comes next, when your mind is fresh, well rested, and well equipped for the tasks at hand, the EMH can appear and feel true.
A quick look at any complex task, say chess or a hard math problem, makes it apparent that it&amp;rsquo;s not universally true. But those System 2 tasks do nothing to dispel the EMH in System 1 heavy situations.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn&amp;rsquo;t always apparent that thinking takes time. It isn&amp;rsquo;t always apparent that System 1 thinking in particular takes time. It isn&amp;rsquo;t always apparent that something requires System 2 thought. And finally it isn&amp;rsquo;t always apparent that thinking has bandwidth, and that ideas and projects can be thought-bandwidth bottlenecked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is that we need to be deliberate with how we choose to spend our brainpower. And this starts with being mindful and intentional with our attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an exercise for the reader: Would the Efficient Minds Hypothesis imply the Efficient Market Hypothesis? How about the reverse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;System 1&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;System 2&amp;rdquo; refer to Kahneman&amp;rsquo;s dichotomy of fast intuitive (System 1) vs slow, deliberate, planned (System 2) thought from 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Thinking, Fast and Slow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Brainstorming: Roam Terminal</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-24-brainstorming-roam-terminal/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-24-brainstorming-roam-terminal/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Roam Research, I&amp;rsquo;d like to be able to type &amp;ldquo;/terminal&amp;rdquo; to insert a shell into my current block. Each command issued in the shell will become a block hidden behind the terminal (nested but collapsed). The output of each command will become a block as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What sorts of commands do you want to be able to issue from within Roam? Deploying snippets. Querying the Roam graph. sshing into another machine and using it natively. Treating Roam like a file system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I&amp;rsquo;d like all the basic shell features (history, basic unix commands sed/grep/ls/cd/awk/&amp;hellip;, piping).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d also like my commands to be able to use my Roam content as inputs. I&amp;rsquo;d like a new type of shell expansion &amp;ndash; expanding block references. echo $((7yNZl3Gf-)) will echo the contents of that block (precise syntax tbd).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pages in the Roam database can be treated like files. cat [[Roam Research]] will output the full contents of the Roam Research page of my graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll have new primitives too, like the unix classics, more suited for the Roam data structure. List all references on a page. grep that list for a keyword. Sort by date. &lt;code&gt;refs Roam Research | grep Conor | sort -t&lt;/code&gt;. There would be primitives for accessing a block&amp;rsquo;s children, parents, refs, backrefs, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course you can write your own commands too. Like 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/google/python-fire&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Python Fire&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;rsquo;ll provide a mechanism to trivially translate any javascript/closure function in your roam/js into a command line utility. The function name becomes the command name. The function arguments become its flags. Help is generated automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real power comes from being able to apply the unix philosophy simultaneously on Roam and on a remote machine. How does this look? Maybe the Roam graph is mounted as a filesystem on the remote machine. /roam/pages/Roam Research.md views [[Roam Research]] as a markdown file. Also viewable as json or edn. Syntactic sugar provided by the shell allows you to operate directly on &amp;ldquo;[[Roam Research]]&amp;rdquo; allowing for natural commands like the one above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can write to pages and blocks via these unix utilities too. Makes it super easy to copy data between the remote machine and your graph in both directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to implement this? roam/render may be essential. 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell-app/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo?hl=en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Secure shell app&lt;/a&gt; (chrome extension) suggests feasibility. There&amp;rsquo;s a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web-based_SSH&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;wikipedia page on Web-based SSH&lt;/a&gt; for inspiration. 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://xtermjs.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;xterm.js&lt;/a&gt; is used in loads of places for javascript-based terminals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rerunning a command from your shell history? Appears as a block reference. Even works for modified commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This just comes for free for being in Roam: you can tag your commands to make them easy to find later. In bash # starts a comment, so the syntax for tagging tag-teams nicely with bash&amp;rsquo;s syntax. Similarly using block and page references in your commands pages it easy to resurface them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For v0 we don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily need a roam/render UI. Instead we could just write some roam/js that listens for ENTER on blocks nested below &amp;ldquo;{{roam/terminal}}&amp;rdquo;. When ENTER is pressed, the block&amp;rsquo;s contents are parsed, the command gets run, output gets streamed to a new block nested below the command. I think a specialized UI could go a long way though. At the very least history search and tab completion are pretty essential shell features, and there are so many more (e.g. curses, colors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I wrap up this idea, I&amp;rsquo;ll also point out the deep similarity between terminal UIs and chat UIs. Both are at their core just call and response. In one you communicate with the computer, in the other with human beings. (With 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/bieber-bot&#34;&gt;Bieber Bot&lt;/a&gt; and my Messager project, it&amp;rsquo;s not always clear which is which 😃.) Details like the number of participants, the format of messages, and whether a response can be issued without a corresponding call are just that: details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we could get a solid terminal experience, legitimately enabling developers to make Roam their default shell, the fusing of note-taking, thinking, and command-issuing that would result would be super powerful. All just a half-baked idea, for now. For now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Snippets Dry Spell</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-21-snippets-dry-spell/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 21 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-21-snippets-dry-spell/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After writing a snippet almost every day this year, the last week has been comparatively sparse. I&amp;rsquo;ve skipped about 7 days recently! Now, I don&amp;rsquo;t have any sort of quota that I&amp;rsquo;m aiming for (unlike last year, where I wanted to communicate publicly 100 times.) So, this isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily a problem. Still, good to reflect on why I&amp;rsquo;ve slowed down in writing snippets and where I&amp;rsquo;ll go next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My recent snippets have been: quirky small Python projects&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, lots of Roam and Browserflow projects&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and some Peer Learning Group planning&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Essentially, almost all my writing has been project-based, usually about programming projects. It&amp;rsquo;s been a month since I&amp;rsquo;ve written about an idea I&amp;rsquo;m not actually acting on&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Let&amp;rsquo;s do more of those. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to set an expectation of myself that I write code or organize a big event for every little snippet. Snippets are supposed to be almost as easy for me to write and publish (but not to broadcast) as it is for me to think. So, self, expect some low-effort low-quality snippets in the coming weeks as we reset this expectation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This growing implicit expectation could be one reason for skipping several days lately. Another is the &amp;ldquo;OPP Back-pressure&amp;rdquo;. OPP stands for &amp;ldquo;Other People&amp;rsquo;s Projects.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself writing a lot about Roam Research, and a bit about Browserflow, both OPP. And with this &amp;ndash; particularly with writing about Roam &amp;ndash; comes an internal pressure to write less about OPP. Can explore this idea more later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the snippet ideas I&amp;rsquo;ve written down for myself that I&amp;rsquo;d like to write eventually:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crashing Facebook Japan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;ldquo;content sharing group&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2021 goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;ldquo;programmer&amp;rsquo;s apprentice&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making decisions for 10,000 people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roam Primitives: subscribe to changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Castles in the clouds (as a mental model for belief systems)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I get around to writing these, I can update this page with links to the snippets. (I don&amp;rsquo;t anticipate writing these in the short-term though.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Magic Functions in Python</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-17-python-magic-functions/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-17-python-magic-functions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this snippet I introduce and implement, but do not condone, Python &amp;ldquo;Magic functions&amp;rdquo;.
Magic functions are interesting to think about and to study, but I discourage their use in anything but the most experimental of code. You&amp;rsquo;ll soon see why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;magic function&lt;/strong&gt; is a function where the arguments and return values are both implicit, handled through the magic of Python&amp;rsquo;s powerful stack introspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the following example, which implements the quadratic formula. Pay special attention to where quadratic_formula is called. No arguments are passed, and the result is not assigned to anything. Still, the program works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;import math
import magic

def quadratic_formula(context):
  magic.unpack(context)
  discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c
  x0, x1 = (
      (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a),
      (-b - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a),
  )
  return magic.context()


def main():
  a, b, c = 1, -1, -12
  magic.call(quadratic_formula)
  print(f&#39;x = {x0} or {x1}  (Discriminant is {discriminant})&#39;)

if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:
  main()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We say quadratic_formula is a &amp;ldquo;magic function&amp;rdquo;, and it is called by invoking magic.call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we run this program, the result is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34;&gt;x = 4.0 or -3.0  (Discriminant is 49)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did a, b, and c get passed to quadratic_formula? How did x0, x1, and discriminant find their way back to main? This is the magic of magic functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To implement a magic function, simply write a function that accepts a single argument &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt;, calls &lt;code&gt;magic.unpack(context)&lt;/code&gt; as its first line, and returns with &lt;code&gt;return magic.context()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To call a magic function, use &lt;code&gt;magic.call(fn)&lt;/code&gt; as in the example above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To &amp;ldquo;install&amp;rdquo; magic, so that you can import it as in the example above, simply save the following three-function Python file as &lt;code&gt;magic.py&lt;/code&gt; in the directory where you&amp;rsquo;d like to use magic functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;import inspect

def call(fn, n=1):
  c = context(n=n+1)
  result = fn(c)
  unpack(result, n=n+1)

def context(n=1):
  c = {}
  caller = inspect.stack()[n]
  caller_frame = caller[0]
  caller_globals = caller_frame.f_globals
  caller_locals = caller_frame.f_locals
  c.update(caller_globals)
  c.update(caller_locals)
  return c

def unpack(c, n=1):
  caller = inspect.stack()[n]
  caller_frame = caller[0]
  caller_frame.f_globals.update(c)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These twenty lines of code comprise the complete implementation of the magic module.
Magic works by inspecting the stack to get the locals and globals when calling a magic function and when returning from a magic function &amp;ndash; this is done in the &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt; function. Magic then makes use of stack inspection a second time to update the globals in the caller after a magic function returns &amp;ndash; this is done in &lt;code&gt;unpack&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What purpose does this all serve? Why would you ever want to use magic functions?
The short answer is that you should &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; use magic functions.
They will confuse readers of your code and are error prone.
Nevertheless, I will explain the situation that prompted me to write this module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write a machine learning training loop and reuse it for many different machine learning training pipelines. Each of the training pipelines needed to track metrics in its own way, save summaries in its own way, make plots in its own way, etc. A natural way to support all of these different needs is with hooks. A hook is a user provided callback function that the training loop library can call each iteration through the loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble with hooks in this situation is that they require either very long argument lists, or bundling of many arguments into a single argument. If different functions need different bundles of arguments, the bundling approach can be quite cumbersome. Also, if two hooks wish to communicate with one another, that needs to be accommodated too. Magic functions provide one mechanism for dealing with this complexity. Different magic hooks can make use of different parts of the training loop&amp;rsquo;s state. A magic hook can also use state set by another hook.
While this approach does satisfactorily address the complexity of writing a training loop library,
I must stress that I do not recommend this approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with real magic, use &lt;code&gt;magic&lt;/code&gt; at your own peril. 🧙‍♀️ 😉&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Python Fire shebang</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-14-the-python-fire-shebang/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-14-the-python-fire-shebang/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy valentine&amp;rsquo;s day! Today&amp;rsquo;s snippet is about a feature of 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/google/python-fire&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Python Fire&lt;/a&gt;, new in v0.4.0, and how you can use it to create Python Fire executables just by adding a shebang to an existing Python file. This idea is courtesy of 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/c6401&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;c6401&lt;/a&gt; in GitHub issue 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/google/python-fire/issues/319&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;#319&lt;/a&gt;. The shebang line is &lt;code&gt;#!/usr/bin/env -S python3 -m fire&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feature introduced in fire v0.4.0 is that &lt;code&gt;python -m fire&lt;/code&gt; now accepts filepaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you have a Python file at &lt;code&gt;path/to/module.py&lt;/code&gt;. Previously, you could invoke module.py as a Fire CLI with the command &lt;code&gt;python -m fire path.to.module&lt;/code&gt;. That still works, but now you can also use the command &lt;code&gt;python -m fire path/to/module.py&lt;/code&gt;. This is roughly equivalent to running module.py and then calling &lt;code&gt;fire.Fire()&lt;/code&gt; as the final line of the module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A consequence of this new feature is that the shebang &lt;code&gt;#!/usr/bin/env -S python3 -m fire&lt;/code&gt; allows you to create executable CLIs out of Python files. &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin/env -S&lt;/code&gt; is explained 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/env-invocation.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. To create a Python Fire executable, simply add the shebang line as the first line of the file, and then use &lt;code&gt;chmod +x&lt;/code&gt; to mark the file as executable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/dbieber/ab8ed63ebbd7afad3c1f19c70028ae31.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save it as e.g. &lt;code&gt;shebang.py&lt;/code&gt;, run &lt;code&gt;chmod +x shebang.py&lt;/code&gt; to make it executable, and run it with &lt;code&gt;./shebang.py hello --name=David&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;&amp;gt; ./shebang.py hello --name=David
Hello David!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>Two more Browserflow flows for Roam Research</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-13-flows-for-roam-research/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Feb 2021 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-13-flows-for-roam-research/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote three Browserflow flows for Roam Research today. None of them took me more than 20-30 minutes to write. The first one was for saving the current webpage to Roam. I 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-13-saving-urls-to-roam-with-browserflow/&#34;&gt;wrote about that flow here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next flow I wrote is for saving any link you click on to Roam. The idea behind this flow is to prevent doing depth first exploration of the web. Better to look at a bunch of links and then later choose the most interesting, than to dive head first into the first link you click on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video of that flow here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/KMxnws2Laww&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I also wrote a flow for saving highlights from any web page to Roam. You can see that flow in action here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/MaV0GP4sZoM&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this flow, whenever I press enter the text I&amp;rsquo;ve highlighted is saved to my Roam Research Daily Notes page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links to all the flows are in the video descriptions. Browserflow is currently in private beta. Looks like in the short-term DK will likely ask 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.notion.so/dkthehuman/Day-404-Choosing-My-Users-2a6b2c9cfc194fd3b561c370a62c60d5&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;$20&lt;/a&gt; for access to the private beta. You can join the waitlist at 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://browserflow.app&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;browserflow.app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Saving URLs to Roam with Browserflow</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-13-saving-urls-to-roam-with-browserflow/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-13-saving-urls-to-roam-with-browserflow/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Using the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-12-javascript-functions-for-inserting-blocks-in-roam/&#34;&gt;Roam JavaScript primitives I wrote yesterday&lt;/a&gt; it was extremely easy (less than 10 minutes, I think) to create a robust Browserflow flow for saving URLs to Roam Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when I&amp;rsquo;m browsing the web, I can press cmd-J (Browserflow&amp;rsquo;s keyboard shortcut) and choose &amp;ldquo;Roam: Save URL&amp;rdquo; from the typeahead to save the current URL to my Roam Daily Notes page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;rsquo;s not already a &amp;ldquo;Saved URLs:&amp;rdquo; block on daily notes, it makes it. Then it nests the URL beneath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what the flow looks like in action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;360&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ORpBuE4UYSA&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what the flow itself looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;save-urls-flow.png&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice there are really only two meaningful lines of code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;let urls = await getOrCreateBlockOnPage($page, &#39;Saved URLs:&#39;, -1);
await createChildBlock(urls, $url)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first line creates the &amp;ldquo;Saved URLs:&amp;rdquo; block, but only if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t already exist. It returns the uid of that block. The second line saves the url. Nothing else to it!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JavaScript Functions for Inserting Blocks in Roam</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-12-javascript-functions-for-inserting-blocks-in-roam/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-12-javascript-functions-for-inserting-blocks-in-roam/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the end of this snippet I include some helpful javascript functions for accessing and inserting pages and blocks in Roam Research. Hope you find these useful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;getPage(page):&lt;/strong&gt; returns the uid of a specific page in your graph. &lt;em&gt;page&lt;/em&gt;: the title of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;getOrCreatePage(page):&lt;/strong&gt; returns the uid of a specific page in your graph, creating it first if it does not already exist. &lt;em&gt;page&lt;/em&gt;: the title of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;getBlockOnPage(page, block):&lt;/strong&gt; returns the uid of a specific block on a specific page. &lt;em&gt;page&lt;/em&gt;: the title of the page. &lt;em&gt;block&lt;/em&gt;: the text of the block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;createBlockOnPage(page, block, order):&lt;/strong&gt; creates a new top-level block on a specific page, returning the new block&amp;rsquo;s uid. &lt;em&gt;page&lt;/em&gt;: the title of the page. &lt;em&gt;block&lt;/em&gt;: the text of the block. &lt;em&gt;order&lt;/em&gt;: (optional) controls where to create the block, 0 for top of page, -1 for bottom of page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;getOrCreateBlockOnPage(page, block, order):&lt;/strong&gt; returns the uid of a specific block on a specific page, creating it first as a top-level block if it&amp;rsquo;s not already there. &lt;em&gt;page&lt;/em&gt;: the title of the page. &lt;em&gt;block&lt;/em&gt;: the text of the block. &lt;em&gt;order&lt;/em&gt;: (optional) controls where to create the block, 0 for top of page, -1 for bottom of page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;getChildBlock(parent_uid, block):&lt;/strong&gt; returns the uid of a specific child block underneath a specific parent block. &lt;em&gt;parent_uid&lt;/em&gt;: the uid of the parent block. &lt;em&gt;block&lt;/em&gt;: the text of the child block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;createChildBlock(parent_uid, block, order):&lt;/strong&gt; creates a new child block underneath a specific parent block, returning the new block&amp;rsquo;s uid. &lt;em&gt;parent_uid&lt;/em&gt;: the uid of the parent block. &lt;em&gt;block&lt;/em&gt;: the text of the new block. &lt;em&gt;order&lt;/em&gt;: (optional) controls where to create the block, 0 for inserting at the top, -1 for inserting at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;getOrCreateChildBlock(parent_uid, block, order):&lt;/strong&gt; returns the uid of a specific child block underneath a specific parent block, creating it first if it&amp;rsquo;s not already there. &lt;em&gt;parent_uid&lt;/em&gt;: the uid of the parent block. &lt;em&gt;block&lt;/em&gt;: the text of the child block. &lt;em&gt;order&lt;/em&gt;: (optional) controls where to create the block, 0 for inserting at the top, -1 for inserting at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caution ⚠️ If multiple blocks with the same text exist on the page, these functions may return the uid of the wrong block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/dbieber/795cf15cad6b46cfbd6cc8213900925d.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use these functions in your Roam database, create a block with the string &lt;code&gt;{{[[roam/js]]}}&lt;/code&gt;, create a code block by typing triple-backticks (```), paste the above JavaScript into the code block, and click &amp;ldquo;Yes, I know what I&amp;rsquo;m doing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, you get the result of an async function with &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt;, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;let uid = await getOrCreateBlockOnPage(
    &amp;quot;February 12, 2020&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Fleeting TODOs:&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The create- and getOrCreate- functions are async, whereas the pure get- functions are regular functions. So, be sure to use await accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Find yourself typing t-ENTER often?</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-10-find-yourself-typing-t-enter-often/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-10-find-yourself-typing-t-enter-often/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A common attention pitfall is to mindless type cmd-t t ENTER. cmd-t creates a new tab. &amp;ldquo;t&amp;rdquo; autocompletes to twitter.com. ENTER. Four keystrokes and you&amp;rsquo;re scrolling. &amp;ldquo;r&amp;rdquo; for reddit. &amp;ldquo;f&amp;rdquo; for facebook. etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less than a second of mindless activity, leading to hundreds of seconds (minutes? hours?) of scrolling that you didn&amp;rsquo;t intend to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the solution. &lt;strong&gt;Delete websites from your browser&amp;rsquo;s autocomplete.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to do. On Mac, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;fn-shift-delete&lt;/strong&gt;. On Windows, just shift-delete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just select the website from Chrome&amp;rsquo;s dropdown and press fn-shift-delete, and the website is removed from your browser&amp;rsquo;s autocomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Firefox, it&amp;rsquo;s even easier: just press shift-delete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually the websites will make their way back into your autocomplete, but it will take a while for this to happen. And when it does, now you know what to do: fn-shift-delete.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What does Browserflow do beyond what Tampermonkey does?</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-09-what-does-browserflow-do-beyond-what-tampermonkey-does/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-09-what-does-browserflow-do-beyond-what-tampermonkey-does/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Someone recently asked me what 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://dkthehuman.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;DK&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://browserflow.app/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Browserflow&lt;/a&gt; does beyond what e.g. 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tampermonkey.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tampermonkey&lt;/a&gt; provides. Here&amp;rsquo;s my answer.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Way&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; easier to use both for programmers and non-programmers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allows recording macros or writing them as &amp;ldquo;flows&amp;rdquo;/programs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything (okay, maybe not &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;ldquo;just works&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; e.g. if you want to write a for loop over tweets on Twitter, you just do. No need to deal with handling scrolling, or with race conditions about when dom elements appear and disappear, or if twitter decides to reuse dom elements, etc. Browserflow takes care of those details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provides high level commands like taking screenshots of elements, writing to csv, selecting parts of a page, looping over elements, getting input from the user, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy to share flows with other users! Unfortunately there&amp;rsquo;s like ~2 other users right now 😛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The typeahead for running flows is super convenient. cmd-J then type a piece of the flow name, then hit enter. The flow runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really it&amp;rsquo;s (3) that sets it apart. The attention to detail in the product is impressive. Thanks DK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience with Tampermonkey is limited, so take this with some salt. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Repurposing my Twitter Feed</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-08-repurposing-my-twitter-feed/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-08-repurposing-my-twitter-feed/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Twitter&amp;rsquo;s addicting. It&amp;rsquo;s not a good use of my time, but I scroll there anyway. If I&amp;rsquo;m going to be scrolling there anyway, might as well make it worthwhile. So, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to repurpose my Twitter timeline and inject things I actually care about into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How? You might think to do this with a Chrome extension, injecting content in between the existing tweets. There&amp;rsquo;s an easier way though. I&amp;rsquo;ve made a new, private Twitter account, and I programmatically&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; tweet as that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal Twitter account is @Bieber, and I use a picture of myself for the profile. The new account goes by &amp;ldquo;Private Bieber&amp;rdquo;, and uses a deep dream-ified version of my profile picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does it decide what to tweet? It chooses tweets from my Roam Research database. I already frequently write down things I&amp;rsquo;d like to learn about, and ideas I&amp;rsquo;d like to try in Roam. It&amp;rsquo;s where I keep my snippet ideas, my spaced repetition system, and my &amp;ldquo;Fleeting TODOs&amp;rdquo;. Source code available in the footnotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fleeting TODOs are what I call TODO items that tug at my brain in the moment, eager to take my attention away from the task at hand. Rather than do them then, I write them down. I only ever get around to doing a small fraction of my fleeting TODOs, but it&amp;rsquo;s nice to have a record of them. It makes it easier to notice if I keep coming back to the same idea, in which case maybe it&amp;rsquo;s worth actually pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I have a script that occasionally &amp;ndash; currently every 10 minutes &amp;ndash; picks out one of these items from my Roam Research database and tweets it in a way that&amp;rsquo;s only visible to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I have my Twitter feed configured to show me tweets chronologically, this means there&amp;rsquo;s always a tweet from Private Bieber sitting at the top, to remind me of something &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; care about, rather than something the &lt;em&gt;Twitter algorithm&lt;/em&gt; has picked out for me to care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fplayground%2FxD83QrK9_D.png?alt=media&amp;amp;token=76f275ac-62fd-4844-829c-b44cf9cf568f&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently the tweet selection is random, but already in this first 20 minutes I&amp;rsquo;ve been happy with the tweets it&amp;rsquo;s been writing. Perhaps in a future iteration I&amp;rsquo;ll make some adjustments to what it tweets and when. It&amp;rsquo;s nice to have this kind of control over my attention, especially in a setting like Twitter where I&amp;rsquo;m so used to mindless scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This same technique ought to work fine for taking control of my Facebook feed too, so perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll get Private Bieber an account there next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/dbieber/47660493954e62f4607cd8d19d54cf59&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Source code is here.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

      <title>Peer Learning Group Sign Up</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-07-peer-learning-group-sign-up/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 07 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-07-peer-learning-group-sign-up/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Peer Learning Group is an experiment for learning new things and meeting new people. I&amp;rsquo;d love for you to join.
The experiment will last for four weeks, and requires only a small time commitment during this period (just a few hours total).
During these four weeks, you will learn about several topics, and you will also teach the group about one or two topics yourself.
The next peer learning group session will be March 1 - March 28, 2021.
If this interests you, I encourage you to sign up here.
Additional details about &amp;ldquo;how it works&amp;rdquo; below the fold. We&amp;rsquo;re 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-07-ways-to-improve-peer-learning-group/&#34;&gt;making some changes&lt;/a&gt; compared to the first group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxG5T0ljW4DAKTM5M0nedNnkMmxxAPgywwv0VZcFAAlWR0yQ/viewform?embedded=true&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;920&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; marginheight=&#34;0&#34; marginwidth=&#34;0&#34;&gt;Loading…&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-it-works&#34;&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 1, everyone will be added to a Facebook Messenger group chat. I&amp;rsquo;m targeting a group of about 6-8 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, I will be contacting everyone to learn what they are interested in learning about. I&amp;rsquo;ll coordinate with you to figure out 1 or 2 topics for you to teach the group about. We&amp;rsquo;ll try to choose topics that both excite you &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; that &lt;em&gt;someone else&lt;/em&gt; in the group is interested in. We&amp;rsquo;ll also select a day for you to do the learning and teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the chosen day, you&amp;rsquo;ll be expected to spend about an hour learning about the selected topic, and sharing what you learn with the group chat. You&amp;rsquo;re welcome to learn about the topic in advance, but that&amp;rsquo;s absolutely not required!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How you share what you&amp;rsquo;ve learned with the group is up to you, but the bar is low. There&amp;rsquo;s no expectation of putting together a lesson plan. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;m envisioning you &amp;ldquo;live tweeting&amp;rdquo; interesting things as you learn them, putting quotes, images, and explanations into the chat that you think communicate the main ideas clearly. But I&amp;rsquo;ll reiterate: how you share what you&amp;rsquo;ve learned is completely up to you, and we&amp;rsquo;re setting our expectations low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone else is welcome to discuss, ask questions, share insights, etc. The chat is there for you to use how you please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since an hour is a relatively short period of time, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to allocate topics to you that are at the fringes of your expertise already. My theory is that while an hour is fairly short, it will still be really rewarding to hear what someone else learns from a concentrated hour of study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the four week period, you&amp;rsquo;ll have &amp;ldquo;presented&amp;rdquo; once or twice, and collectively we&amp;rsquo;ll have learned about ~10 different topics in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to meet people and learn new things, and also to have fun. So come curious and with an open mind, and we&amp;rsquo;ll do our best to make this an interesting and enjoyable month.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ways to improve Peer Learning Group</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-07-ways-to-improve-peer-learning-group/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 07 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-07-ways-to-improve-peer-learning-group/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this snippet I list out things I plan to do to improve Peer Learning Group for a future iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-fewer-topics-per-day&#34;&gt;1. Fewer topics per day&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first round of Peer Learning Group, we had a topic almost every single day, with just two days off in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next round, I&amp;rsquo;ll either have fewer people or a longer period of time for the program (e.g. 4-6 weeks), such that there&amp;rsquo;s only ever someone teaching every 3-5 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives more time to think, reflect, and breathe. More time to have adhoc discussions without feeling like you&amp;rsquo;re talking out of turn. More time for questions and connections between topics to bubble up. More time for unrelated topics to come up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-give-people-topics-theyre-interested-in&#34;&gt;2. Give people topics they&amp;rsquo;re interested in&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first round of Peer Learning Group, I aimed to give people topics at the edge of their expertise. I tried to give people a topic that would really interest &lt;em&gt;someone else&lt;/em&gt; in the group. In the next iteration, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to pick topics for people that more closely align with their own interests. Still not things that they&amp;rsquo;re experts in already, but rather topics that they&amp;rsquo;re excited to learn about themselves. I&amp;rsquo;ll still aim to make sure the topics we choose are interesting to other people in the group too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-choose-a-unifying-theme-for-the-group-maybe&#34;&gt;3. Choose a unifying theme for the group, maybe&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first round, the topics were pretty diverse: we had &amp;ldquo;cultivating conscious leadership&amp;rdquo;, the Ethereum EVM, Jungian archetypes, Microbubbles, carcinisation, complexity management, and several more. There was minimal overlap in the ~40 topic suggestions I received while setting up the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next round, I&amp;rsquo;m toying with the idea of picking an overarching topic, like climate change, machine learning, math, or physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious to hear what people think of this idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-encourage-use-of-background-knowledge&#34;&gt;4. Encourage use of background knowledge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more about my own teaching experience than running the group overall. As I was teaching my topic (Asynchronous Teaching), I was initially reticent to share things I already knew, instead focusing on sharing only what I learned during my teaching session. In retrospect, it is definitely valuable to share background knowledge, not just newly obtained information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious to hear if other people had a similar experience to myself on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-include-a-synchronous-component&#34;&gt;5. Include a synchronous component&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty much everything was asynchronous in the first group. Not too late to change this though! Even though our Peer Learning Group experiment is coming to a close, we can still set up a synchronous social gathering for next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;6-ask-more-questions&#34;&gt;6. Ask more questions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a personal change I would make, not a group change. In the next round, I&amp;rsquo;m going to make more of an effort to ask well thought out questions on many of the topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;thank-you&#34;&gt;Thank you&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed the first Peer Learning Group. Every evening there was a new thread about an interesting topic delivered to my inbox via messenger. We learned so much, and I had a great time with it. Big &lt;em&gt;thank you&lt;/em&gt; to all the participants for making this experiment a success 🙏 🎉. Couldn&amp;rsquo;t have done it at all without you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Flow for Focused Reading</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-05-focused-reading/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-05-focused-reading/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the snippet you&amp;rsquo;re currently reading, I&amp;rsquo;ve implemented a simple tool to help with focused reading. (It&amp;rsquo;s 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-02-focused-reading-browserflow-flow-idea/&#34;&gt;the idea from the previous snippet&lt;/a&gt;). The majority of the page is dimmed, except for a few lines above and below your mouse cursor. As you move your mouse, the focused region follows. Give it a try; move your mouse (or touch) over the next paragraph, and watch as the light region follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is useful for staying focused when reading. If your eyes or mind wander while reading, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to quickly bring your attention back to exactly where you left off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://browserflow.app&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Browserflow&lt;/a&gt; users among you (psst&amp;hellip; DK, you need to ship Browserflow so there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; Browserflow users out there), you can enable this effect on any page using 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://browserflow.app/shared/8c2f3de8-2666-4578-8b42-58f5cad105b0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this BrowserFlow flow I made&lt;/a&gt;. Once you get the flow you can simply type cmd-J and select &amp;ldquo;Focus Bar&amp;rdquo; from the typeahead to enable this effect anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For everyone else, you can paste this script into your JavaScript console. 🤷&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;var mouseY = 0;
var scrollY = 0;
var offset = 50;
var div_below, div_above;

div_below = document.createElement(&amp;quot;div&amp;quot;);
div_below.style.position = &amp;quot;absolute&amp;quot;;
div_below.style.left = &amp;quot;0px&amp;quot;;
div_below.style.top = &amp;quot;0px&amp;quot;;
div_below.style.width = &amp;quot;100%&amp;quot;;
div_below.style.height = &amp;quot;100%&amp;quot;;
div_below.style.background = &amp;quot;black&amp;quot;;
div_below.style.opacity = &amp;quot;30%&amp;quot;;

div_above = document.createElement(&amp;quot;div&amp;quot;);
div_above.style.position = &amp;quot;absolute&amp;quot;;
div_above.style.left = &amp;quot;0px&amp;quot;;
div_above.style.bottom = &amp;quot;0px&amp;quot;;
div_above.style.width = &amp;quot;100%&amp;quot;;
div_above.style.height = &amp;quot;100%&amp;quot;;
div_above.style.background = &amp;quot;black&amp;quot;;
div_above.style.opacity = &amp;quot;30%&amp;quot;;

document.body.appendChild(div_below);
document.body.appendChild(div_above);

function adjust_divs() {
  scrollY = window.pageYOffset || document.documentElement.scrollTop || document.body.scrollTop || 0;
  div_below.style.top = (mouseY + offset + scrollY) + &#39;px&#39;;
  div_above.style.bottom = (
      &#39;calc(100% - &#39; + (mouseY - offset + scrollY) + &#39;px&#39;);
  div_below.style.height = (
      &#39;calc(100% - &#39; + (mouseY + offset) + &#39;px&#39;);
}

document.addEventListener(&#39;mousemove&#39;, function(event) {
  mouseY = event.clientY;
  adjust_divs();
}, true);

document.addEventListener(&#39;scroll&#39;, function(event) {
  adjust_divs();
}, true);
document.addEventListener(&#39;touchstart&#39;, function(event) {
  mouseY = event.touches[0].clientY;
  adjust_divs();
}, true);
document.addEventListener(&#39;touchmove&#39;, function(event) {
  mouseY = event.touches[0].clientY;
  adjust_divs();
}, true);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry about the jitter. Let me know if you know how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Focused Reading Browserflow Flow Idea</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-02-focused-reading-browserflow-flow-idea/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 02 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-02-focused-reading-browserflow-flow-idea/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This idea for an assistive technology for focused reading comes from 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://accessibe.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;accessiBe&lt;/a&gt;. I stumbled upon it on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/homemade-potato-chips/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;tasteofhome.com&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is to make the web more accessible to folks with ADHD by dimming the part of the screen they&amp;rsquo;re not actively looking at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a video of the accessiBe implementation in action on the tasteofhome.com website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fplayground%2FbF12xbo8EB.gif?alt=media&amp;amp;token=d1cc35a1-8354-4859-9415-7a48e5283310&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the screen is dimmed everywhere except on the lines surrounding the mouse pointer. This helps me to regain focus more quickly if my attention is drawn away from the text I was reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find this way of reading helpful, and so I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about making it for myself as a Browserflow flow. It should be easy enough to do. When the flow starts, it just has to add two large transparent rectangles to the DOM, and an event handler to update their positions whenever my mouse moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll put up another snippet if and when I build this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update Feb 5, 2021: As you may have noticed, I&amp;rsquo;ve now implemented this idea. It&amp;rsquo;s enabled on this page, and also available as a Browserflow flow. 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-05-focused-reading&#34;&gt;See the snippet here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Asking for upvotes</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-31-asking-for-upvotes/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-31-asking-for-upvotes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello! Can I let you know when I post new content? In particular, can I let you know when I post things to e.g. Hacker News, which require upvotes to be seen? This should go without saying: there&amp;rsquo;s no pressure to actually upvote anything &amp;ndash; but if you think my submission deserves it and you do upvote it, that&amp;rsquo;s much appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;, let me know. You can let me know 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.messenger.com/t/dbieber&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;on Facebook messenger&lt;/a&gt;, or you can fill out this form. Info about the &lt;em&gt;content-sharing group&lt;/em&gt; option below the fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeKINUItuKwpf_wG221Q2c-QnntQabeXTGPFtzUrhlF9H6qvw/viewform?embedded=true&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;765&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; marginheight=&#34;0&#34; marginwidth=&#34;0&#34;&gt;Loading…&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;content-sharing group&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;rdquo;, you may be wondering. It&amp;rsquo;s a small Facebook messenger group where the social norm is to share your creative output. This is a place to share things you&amp;rsquo;ve made, posts you&amp;rsquo;ve written, or progress updates on your latest side-project. All sharing of this kind is welcome. Feel free to brag. Incremental updates are welcome too, so there&amp;rsquo;s no need to wait until a project is finished. It&amp;rsquo;s not spamming; it&amp;rsquo;s what the group is for! To join, just let me know or fill out the form and I&amp;rsquo;ll add you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SQL for the Kangaroo Auto-responder</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-30-sql-for-the-kangaroo-auto-responder/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 30 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-30-sql-for-the-kangaroo-auto-responder/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I turned on the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-29-kangaroo-auto-responder/&#34;&gt;Kangaroo Auto-responder&lt;/a&gt; this morning. The rules for when to send a kangaroo 🦘 are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get a kangaroo if the &lt;strong&gt;most-recent&lt;/strong&gt; message in our chat (ignoring trivial messages from you) is &lt;strong&gt;non-trivial&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;read-by-me&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;written-by-you&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;not a response&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;eight-hours old&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at each of these criteria in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;most-recent-message&#34;&gt;Most-recent message&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criteria are being applied to the most recent message in our chat ignoring trivial messages from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In SQL, this looks like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;select thread_id, max(timestamp) as timestamp
from messenger
where (author = &#39;1409114395&#39; or (author &amp;lt;&amp;gt; &#39;1409114395&#39; and LENGTH(text) &amp;gt; 15))
group by thread_id;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1409114395 is my Facebook ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This query selects the most recent timestamp from only a single message in each thread. It considers all messages from me, but only non-trivial (more than 15 characters) messages from the other participant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is that if I have sent the most recent message in a conversation (regardless of the length of the message), then no kangaroo is needed. If the other person has sent the most recent message, a kangaroo might be in order, but trivial messages should not trigger kangaroos. So we ignore them, and see if the most recent message is still from the other person even when ignoring their trivial messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;non-trivial&#34;&gt;Non-trivial&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We choose 15-characters as the threshold for what makes a message trivial. The reason we ignore trivial messages is because they often don&amp;rsquo;t warrant a response. I am considering removing this constraint, as the &amp;ldquo;Not a response&amp;rdquo; constraint seems to obviate the need for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shows up as &lt;code&gt;LENGTH(text) &amp;gt; 15)&lt;/code&gt; in the query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;read-by-me&#34;&gt;Read-by-me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I do not have read receipt information in my messages database, so I did not include this rule in the first version of the Kangaroo Auto-responder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;written-by-you&#34;&gt;Written-by-you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only if the most recent message is from you is a kangaroo necessary. If its from me, I&amp;rsquo;ve already responded!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this query, this is a simple check:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;WHERE messenger.author &amp;lt;&amp;gt; &#39;1409114395&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;not-a-response&#34;&gt;Not-a-response&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting piece. When I wrote out the rules for the auto-responder yesterday, I was thinking I&amp;rsquo;d ignore messages sent within 5 minutes of a message I sent. My thinking was that this small filter would prevent me from needing to get the last word in every conversation to avoid oversending of kangaroos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;rsquo;m thinking I&amp;rsquo;ll ignore messages sent within &lt;em&gt;36 hours&lt;/em&gt; of a message I sent. This is a much tighter restriction. It means that I may miss sending some kangaroos that I ought to have sent, but it also means that if someone takes two hours to reply to me and that&amp;rsquo;s the end of the conversation, I don&amp;rsquo;t need to reply to prevent a kangaroo from going out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like striking a good balance between the non-trivial message criteria and the not-a-response criteria is key, and I may adjust these going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine if a message is a response, I first determine the time of my own most recent message in the chat. In SQL, this is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;select thread_id, max(timestamp) as outgoing_timestamp
from messenger
where author = &#39;1409114395&#39; -- my FB id
group by thread_id;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then compare this message&amp;rsquo;s timestamp with that of the most recent message in the thread, which we selected earlier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;(  -- The reply is at least X minutes after my latest message.
  (latest_messages.timestamp - outgoing_timestamp)/1000 &amp;gt; 36*60*60
  or outgoing_timestamp IS NULL
)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;8-hours-old&#34;&gt;8-hours old&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final criteria for whether to send a kangaroo is that the message must be eight hours old. Yesterday I was initially planning for 2-hours old, but I decided to give myself more time to respond manually before the kangaroo would go out. Here&amp;rsquo;s the SQL for that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;-- Message is 8 hours old:
AND NOW() - to_timestamp(messenger.timestamp/1000) at time zone &#39;UTC&#39; &amp;gt; INTERVAL &#39;8 HOURS&#39;
AND NOW() - to_timestamp(messenger.timestamp/1000) at time zone &#39;UTC&#39; &amp;lt; INTERVAL &#39;8.25 HOURS&#39;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;putting-it-all-together&#34;&gt;Putting it all together&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the complete SQL query that finds messages which warrant an automated kangaroo response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;-- Select the most recent message per thread
-- (ignoring trivial messages from you),
-- and the most recent message per thread specifically from me.
-- If the most recent message (ignoring trivial messages from you)
-- is non-trivial,
-- written-by-you,
-- not a reply to my message,
-- and a specific age,
-- then we&#39;ve got ourselves a Kangaroo!
--
-- In a future iteration we will also ensure the message has been read-by-me.

SELECT * FROM

-- The first sub-query:
-- Selects the most recent message from each thread that is either:
-- (A) from me, or (B) from you and non-trivial in length
-- And is also less than 8 hours old.
((select thread_id, max(timestamp) as timestamp
 from messenger
 where (author = &#39;1409114395&#39; or (author &amp;lt;&amp;gt; &#39;1409114395&#39; and LENGTH(text) &amp;gt; 15))
 -- and to_timestamp(timestamp/1000) at time zone &#39;UTC&#39; &amp;gt; NOW() - INTERVAL &#39;800 HOURS&#39;
 group by thread_id) AS latest_messages
INNER JOIN
  messenger
ON
  messenger.thread_id = latest_messages.thread_id AND
  messenger.timestamp = latest_messages.timestamp)
LEFT JOIN
    -- Selects the most recent message from each thread from me:
    (select thread_id, max(timestamp) as outgoing_timestamp
     from messenger
     where author = &#39;1409114395&#39;
     -- and to_timestamp(timestamp/1000) at time zone &#39;UTC&#39; &amp;gt; NOW() - INTERVAL &#39;800 HOURS&#39;
     group by thread_id) AS latest_outgoing_messages
ON
  messenger.thread_id = latest_outgoing_messages.thread_id
WHERE messenger.author &amp;lt;&amp;gt; &#39;1409114395&#39; -- David Bieber
AND messenger.author &amp;lt;&amp;gt; &#39;1985867351654140&#39; -- Bieber Bot
AND (  -- The reply is at least X minutes after my latest message.
  (latest_messages.timestamp - outgoing_timestamp)/1000 &amp;gt; 36*60*60
  or outgoing_timestamp IS NULL
)
AND thread_type = &#39;USER&#39; -- Message is a 1:1 chat, not a group chat
-- Message is 8 hours old:
AND NOW() - to_timestamp(messenger.timestamp/1000) at time zone &#39;UTC&#39; &amp;gt; INTERVAL &#39;8 HOURS&#39;
AND NOW() - to_timestamp(messenger.timestamp/1000) at time zone &#39;UTC&#39; &amp;lt; INTERVAL &#39;8.25 HOURS&#39;
ORDER BY messenger.timestamp desc;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This checks all the criteria for whether a message needs a kangaroo. I&amp;rsquo;ve set up a script that runs this query every ten minutes, and sends kangaroos as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of this writing, no kangaroos have been sent yet. I hope it works 🤞!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Avoid people expecting a response from me when I don&amp;rsquo;t realize they&amp;rsquo;re expecting a response, e.g. because I&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten about their message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should let me let my guard down a bit about feeling obligated to respond to people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will it do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will automatically respond to messages that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen but haven&amp;rsquo;t responded to for 2+ hours with a kangaroo&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time it sends someone a kangaroo, it will also explain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;[Kangaroo] Hello! This is an automated reply from the Kangaroo Auto-responder. You&amp;rsquo;re getting this message because it looks like David might forget to reply to your message. If you want a response, you should contact him again. (Just saying &amp;ldquo;ping&amp;rdquo; is often enough!)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text for the second time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;[Kangaroo] Me again. David might forget to reply to your message. In the future I&amp;rsquo;ll just send you a picture of a Kangaroo to symbolize this. 🦘  If you ever get a picture of a Kangaroo from me, it just means David may have dropped the ball on your message and you should contact him again if you&amp;rsquo;re expecting a response.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequent kangaroos will be unaccompanied by explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The details on exactly when to send kangaroos are still a work in progress. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to overwhelm anyone with kangaroos. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about some rules: (1) only send kangaroos if there was a message of non-trivial length, e.g. more than 20 characters, (2) only send a kangaroo after I&amp;rsquo;ve read the message; if I genuinely haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the message yet, no need for a kangaroo, as the message will still appear as unread in my inbox, (3) if you send follow-up messages, that resets the timer on the 2 hours, (4) any messages you send within 5 minutes of me sending you a message are ineligible for triggering kangaroos (this way I don&amp;rsquo;t need to get the last word), and (5) obviously, don&amp;rsquo;t send a kangaroo for a message I&amp;rsquo;ve already responded too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize, the rules of kangaroos are: You get a kangaroo if the &lt;strong&gt;most-recent&lt;/strong&gt; message in our chat is &lt;strong&gt;non-trivial&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;read-by-me&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;written-by-you&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;not an immediate reply&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;two-hours old&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why kangaroos? They bounce 🤷‍♂️ ? This is kind of like a message bouncing&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a picture of a kangaroo, that is. Like this one: 🦘, or this: &lt;img src=&#34;https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fplayground%2FtBz98tV75N.png?alt=media&amp;amp;token=66762cac-d0b0-43ba-91a8-eaefa6ef7626&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt; It will not send them an actual real-life kangaroo. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Notifications in Roam Research</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-25-notifications-in-roam-research/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-25-notifications-in-roam-research/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoamGames&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;#RoamGames&lt;/a&gt; are upon us! The challenge: &lt;em&gt;project management&lt;/em&gt; in Roam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let&amp;rsquo;s talk notifications. They&amp;rsquo;re going to be essential for any multiplayer Roam scenario. They&amp;rsquo;re also ruthless attention vampires that kill productivity. We&amp;rsquo;ve got to get this right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s disentangle &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; you get notified about, &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; you get notified about it, and &lt;em&gt;where/how&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;rsquo;re notified. This leads us to a vision where users can define &lt;em&gt;notification strategies&lt;/em&gt; and take control of their attention&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-to-notify-on-references-and-queries&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&lt;/strong&gt; to notify on (References and Queries)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we want to get notified about? First, three scenarios to motivate our discussion. Then, the primitives: references and queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;scenario-1-chat&#34;&gt;Scenario 1, Chat:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re working on Secret Project X, conversing asynchronously with your teammate Abhay about Feature XX. It&amp;rsquo;s gonna be big. While you&amp;rsquo;re off working on something else Abhay responds to a bunch of your earlier messages. You want to get notified about this, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;scenario-2-blockers&#34;&gt;Scenario 2, Blockers:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re working on Task A. But it&amp;rsquo;s blocked by Tasks B and C. You represent this in your Roam graph like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fplayground%2FjLpcHwI9aQ.png?alt=media&amp;amp;token=eeb11581-2466-4824-a725-35a0bd720eff&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As an aside, being able to embed a tiny piece of my Roam graph in my blog would be super helpful.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Task B and Task C are marked DONE, you want to get notified so you can resume working on Task A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;scenario-3-topic-tracking&#34;&gt;Scenario 3, Topic Tracking:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re in a big multiplayer graph and you&amp;rsquo;ve carefully curated a page about your own project 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/google/python-fire&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Python Fire&lt;/a&gt;. You&amp;rsquo;re excited when people talk about Fire, so you want notifications when people reference it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-primitives-references-and-queries&#34;&gt;The Primitives: References and Queries&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic usage: Notifications when someone responds to me&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, notifications when someone references a particular page or block (linked or unlinked)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced usage: Roam queries and Datalog queries&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; are extremely expressive. I should be able to set up a query and get notified whenever the query results change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve set out what we want to get notified about, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about when we want to receive the notifications. We&amp;rsquo;ll get to how we want to configure the notifications a little bit later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-to-notify-immediately-batched-delayed-at-specific-times&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When&lt;/strong&gt; to notify (Immediately, Batched, Delayed, At specific times?)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most apps have minimal options for when you receive notifications. A typical message board config offers &amp;ldquo;every individual email&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;daily digest&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;weekly digest.&amp;rdquo; This is Roam. We can do better than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the messages from Abhay about Project XX, I want notifications to pop up immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I become unblocked on a task, I want a notification within the hour, but if multiple tasks become unblocked they the notifications can totally be bundled. I don&amp;rsquo;t need an &lt;em&gt;individual notification&lt;/em&gt; per task. That would just be overkill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for references to Python Fire, a daily digest at 9am is more than sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;primitive-notification-strategies&#34;&gt;Primitive: Notification Strategies&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone with a bit of JavaScript or Clojure knowledge can define a notification strategy. A notification strategy defines the rules for how notifications should be handled. The interface for a notification strategy is: stream of notifications in, stream of notifications out.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By allowing users to define and share notification strategies, we can empower uses to take back their attention and get more out of their Roam experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Notification strategies&amp;rdquo; approach benefits non-programmers too, because notification strategies can be shared in the Roam Depot&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping for a future where RoamHacker and David Vargas and others have developed both simple and sophisticated &amp;ldquo;notification managers&amp;rdquo;: UIs where non-programmers can configure their notification settings in the level of detail best suited for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;primitive-tags-connect-references-and-queries-to-notification-strategies&#34;&gt;Primitive: Tags connect references and queries to notification strategies&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, tags connect &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you write a notification strategy, you name it. Tag a reference of a query with the name of a notification strategy to run that strategy on that reference or query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s clarify with an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say I have a query (&amp;ldquo;all Tasks with &amp;lsquo;Blockers&amp;rsquo; where all Blockers are &amp;lsquo;DONE&amp;rsquo;&amp;quot;), and a notification strategy named &amp;ldquo;Bundle on the Hour&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;bundle all incoming notifications and emit them on the hour as a single notification&amp;rdquo;). Then I can tag the query with #[[Bundle on the Hour]] to start applying that notification strategy to the results of the query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I&amp;rsquo;ve added that tag, the notification strategy will be called every time the query results change, and it will be able to start emitting notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly if I write [[Python Fire]] and tag it with #[[Digest at 9am]], then &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; notification strategy will be called whenever the references to or contents of the Python Fire page change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wherehow-actually-sending-notifications&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where/How&lt;/strong&gt;: Actually sending notifications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great, we&amp;rsquo;ve talked about how to decide what to notify about, and when to send the notifications. How/where do the notifications actually get sent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sensible default for the first pass is to use browser notifications. But we&amp;rsquo;re thinking long term, so I won&amp;rsquo;t dwell on this &amp;ldquo;first pass&amp;rdquo; for too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do want to use browser notifications, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to do so&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. You can try this in your Roam graph (or browser console&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) right now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;function notify(text) {
  // Let&#39;s check if the browser supports notifications
  if (!(&amp;quot;Notification&amp;quot; in window)) {
    alert(text);
  }

  // Let&#39;s check whether notification permissions have already been granted
  else if (Notification.permission === &amp;quot;granted&amp;quot;) {
    // If it&#39;s okay let&#39;s create a notification
    var notification = new Notification(text);
  }

  // Otherwise, we need to ask the user for permission
  else if (Notification.permission !== &amp;quot;denied&amp;quot;) {
    Notification.requestPermission().then(function (permission) {
      // If the user accepts, let&#39;s create a notification
      if (permission === &amp;quot;granted&amp;quot;) {
        var notification = new Notification(text);
      } else {
        console.log(text);
      }
    });
  } else {
    // At last, if the user has denied notifications, and you
    // want to be respectful there is no need to bother them any more.
    console.log(text);
  }
}

notify(&amp;quot;You&#39;ve got mail.&amp;quot;);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want browser notifications though. I want my personal digital assistant 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/bieber-bot/&#34;&gt;Bieber Bot&lt;/a&gt; to send me notifications. Now, this is no trouble in a private graph. I can use a webhook to send myself a message as Bieber Bot. In a public graph, however, this would be dangerous. Anyone could see the code and start impersonating Bieber Bot. A travesty!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we need Roam to support &lt;em&gt;secrets&lt;/em&gt;. Ideally this would come from the Roam core team, not the community. First class secrets would enable me to write roam/js that communicates securely with my own services, like Bieber Bot and others, without giving other users the capability of doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an alternative approach to secrets, having all Roam graphs be &lt;em&gt;one giant graph&lt;/em&gt; with a good permissions model would also be sufficient. Then I could put my notifier code in my graph (private), but have the queries that trigger the notifier apply to a graph I share with my team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does specifying a notifier (browser notifications vs Bieber Bot) fit in with writing queries and enabling notifications? You can set your default &amp;ldquo;notify&amp;rdquo; function just by defining the function &amp;ldquo;notify&amp;rdquo; and tagging it / nesting it under roam/notify. You can also set a notify function whenever you define notifications just by adding an extra reference with the name of the notify function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-examples&#34;&gt;Some Examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a lot, and reading the above it might sound complicated. And that&amp;rsquo;s because it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be complicated; you can have as complicated a notification strategy as you like. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be complicated, and for most users it won&amp;rsquo;t be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally turning on notifications for messages could be as simple as adding a block in your graph that says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[[roam/messages]] #[[Notify me immediately]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning on notifications for unblocked tasks could be as simple as (1) getting the unblocked tasks query from the Roam Depot, and then (2) adding a block &lt;code&gt;[[Unblocked tasks]] #[[Bundle on the Hour]]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And turning on notifications for references to Python Fire should simply mean adding a block &lt;code&gt;[[Python Fire]] #[[Digest at 9am]]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lets-build-it&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s build it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to build this with me? I&amp;rsquo;m 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Bieber&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;@Bieber&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter and active as dbieber on the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://roamresearch.slack.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Roam Slack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And still provides sensible defaults and easy configs for non-power users. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one, while a basic use case, is actually tricky to express as a query. But we can do it, I&amp;rsquo;m confident. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;https://capnfabs.net/posts/margin-notes-hugo-theme/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;excellent post&lt;/a&gt; where he adds margin notes to his own hugo blog. We&amp;rsquo;ll be using that for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my Fiverr experience I&amp;rsquo;ll update this snippet or add a new one, ideally one full of margin notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update (same day): I&amp;rsquo;m back! I didn&amp;rsquo;t use Fiverr. I used the post on capnfabs for reference and set up margin notes myself. Thank you Fabian for documenting your process.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ll have to learn to use Fiverr another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m glad to have this working. There&amp;rsquo;s room to improve the style though. Perhaps in a future iteration I&amp;rsquo;ll move the main content left to give more space for the margin notes, or make some changes to the font and size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like this to be a margin note. At the time of this writing, it&amp;rsquo;s a footnote. &lt;em&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt;: Now it&amp;rsquo;s a margin note! At least if your browser is wide enough&amp;hellip; otherwise it&amp;rsquo;s still a footnote. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve used it twice before, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a great experience with the one programmer I hired. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, it is greatly appreciated! 🙏 &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

      <title>am I available for conversation right now dot com</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-22-am-i-available-for-conversation-right-now-dot-com/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-22-am-i-available-for-conversation-right-now-dot-com/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I like this idea, but I&amp;rsquo;m giving it a try; I&amp;rsquo;ve added a &amp;ldquo;Now&amp;rdquo; page to my website (
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/now/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;davidbieber.com/now&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea for now pages is described at &lt;a href=&#34;https://nownownow.com/about&#34;&gt;https://nownownow.com/about&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, a now page says what&amp;rsquo;s going on in the author&amp;rsquo;s life now. Not &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; that would be a &amp;ldquo;right now page&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; but rather, now in the broader sense of &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s are you up to these days?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post isn&amp;rsquo;t about my new Now page though, which I don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily plan to keep up (if the link 404s, you know why). Rather, this post is about an idea for a kind of &amp;ldquo;right now&amp;rdquo; page that I&amp;rsquo;m toying with building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to make a page that tells the reader if I&amp;rsquo;m likely available for a conversation &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;d call it the &amp;ldquo;is David available to talk now&amp;rdquo; page, and here&amp;rsquo;s how it might work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;it-aims-only-to-give-a-best-guess-as-to-whether-i-can-talk-now&#34;&gt;It aims only to give a best guess as to whether I can talk now.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It says No during work.&lt;br/&gt;
It says No during sleep hours.&lt;br/&gt;
It says No while I&amp;rsquo;m on a phone call / skype / zoom / meet etc&lt;br/&gt;
It says No if I have recently been on a call for a long time&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It says Yes during explicitly times (there would be a button I can press to set it to Yes for 30 minutes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;rsquo;m deliberately in a public space (e.g. Gather Town, Clubhouse) AND looking for conversation (aka I&amp;rsquo;ve pushed the button), then it shows where to find me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the rest of the time, it simply shrugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-would-i-want-such-a-system&#34;&gt;Why would I want such a system?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, what I really want is for &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; to use such a system. I want the &amp;ldquo;open door&amp;rdquo; system that professors so often use; if my door is open, you&amp;rsquo;re welcome to come in and talk. I want to avoid people avoiding saying hi because they don&amp;rsquo;t know if I&amp;rsquo;m available. And I want to avoid the mental overhead of making plans for conversations that aren&amp;rsquo;t time sensitive. Plans are tough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ideal system for when I want to talk to someone isn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s pick a time to talk&amp;rdquo;, because that has scheduling overhead and will likely break up my day at an inconvenient time. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;d prefer a more flexible approach. When I&amp;rsquo;m free, I open my door (a digital, virtual, door). I send you a message that I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk; you see it when you&amp;rsquo;re free (because you have notifications disabled 👍). If I&amp;rsquo;m still free then, my door will still be open and we can talk. If I&amp;rsquo;ve moved on to another activity, my door will be closed and we&amp;rsquo;ll reconnect later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of doors, the &amp;ldquo;is David available to talk now&amp;rdquo; page is my idea for an approximation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don&amp;rsquo;t know yet how I would build it. The idea requires programmatically determining when I&amp;rsquo;ve been on the phone, in skype, in zoom, etc. I haven&amp;rsquo;t looking into how approachable these services are to work with. And I likely wont. This is the sort of idea that, while fun to entertain, will likely need to morph considerably before it turns into a real project. Such is the nature of the Snippet.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Clubhouse feature request: save last 60 seconds</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-20-clubhouse-feature-request-save-last-60-seconds/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-20-clubhouse-feature-request-save-last-60-seconds/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a feature request for Clubhouse. Zoom, Meet, Skype, if you&amp;rsquo;re listening, this is a feature request for you all too. The request is a button to save the &lt;em&gt;previous&lt;/em&gt; 60 seconds of audio. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re interested because people will share the clips on social media and drive more traffic back to CH 📈🤷‍♂️. I just want the feature for note-taking 📝. Details follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-button&#34;&gt;The button&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little floppy disk save icon. 💾. Non intrusive. When clicked, it triggers a save.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;just-60-seconds&#34;&gt;Just 60 seconds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous 60 seconds of audio are saved. This means a circular buffer of 60 seconds of audio is being stored at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t just blindly save everything, because that&amp;rsquo;s a lot of data to wade through (and to store). I just want to save the good parts. So when someone says something insightful, I click save. The rest is lost to history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;respecting-privacy&#34;&gt;Respecting Privacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If no one clicks save, the audio is gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone does click save, the speakers still can choose not to have their own audio saved. Since everyone&amp;rsquo;s on their own phone, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to save an audio clip with e.g. everyone-except-David&amp;rsquo;s audio, if David decides they don&amp;rsquo;t want their audio saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe David never wants their audio saved except when he explicitly allows it. That&amp;rsquo;s fine. That&amp;rsquo;s a setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bonus-points&#34;&gt;Bonus points&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus points for automatic transcription. Additional bonus points for saving the audio clip and its transcription to a Roam database. Still more bonus points for allowing sharing the clips to TikTok or Instagram or wherever, but I don&amp;rsquo;t use those, so someone else will have to provide the points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prior-art&#34;&gt;Prior Art&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://obsproject.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;OBS Studio&lt;/a&gt; has a feature for recording a circular video buffer. They call it the &amp;ldquo;replay buffer.&amp;rdquo; Streamers use it for instant replays, for example. I use it myself for screen recordings sometimes, so I can decide retroactively that something was worth saving, without having to waste gigabytes of storage recording everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/heard/id615420427&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;apps&lt;/a&gt; for a long time now offering cameras and audio recorders with this circular buffer feature to allow capturing the past. However, it&amp;rsquo;s never been integrated into a social product before, as far as I&amp;rsquo;m aware. Clubhouse, let&amp;rsquo;s change that.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Python hoist: immediate locals only</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-18-python-hoist-locals-only/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-18-python-hoist-locals-only/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The implementation of &lt;code&gt;hoist&lt;/code&gt; in my 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-16-python-hoist/&#34;&gt;earlier snippet&lt;/a&gt; returned the values of local variables of all functions called by the hoisted function. This new version only returns the locals of the hoisted function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As before, you can use it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;def f(x):
  y = x + 1
  z = y * 2
  return z + 1

f(4) == 11
hoist(f)(4) == {&#39;x&#39;: 4, &#39;y&#39;: 5, &#39;z&#39;: 10, &#39;return&#39;: 11}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s another usage example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;def f(x):
  y = messy_g(x + 1)
  return y + 1

def messy_g(z):
  q = z * 9
  w = q / 3
  return w + 1

f(1) == 8
hoist(f)(1) == {&#39;x&#39;: 1, &#39;y&#39;: 7, &#39;return&#39;: 8}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice in this example that the local variables used by &lt;code&gt;messy_g&lt;/code&gt; are not returned by &lt;code&gt;hoist(f)&lt;/code&gt;. Only &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rsquo;s local variables are returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;import functools
import inspect
import sys

def make_trace(results, f, original_trace_fn):
  def trace_local(frame, event, arg):
    # event: &#39;call&#39;, &#39;line&#39;, &#39;return&#39;, &#39;exception&#39; or &#39;opcode&#39;
    if event == &#39;line&#39;:
      arg_info = inspect.getargvalues(frame)
      results.update(arg_info.locals.copy())
    if event == &#39;return&#39;:
      arg_info = inspect.getargvalues(frame)
      values = arg_info.locals.copy()
      results.update(values)
      results[&#39;return&#39;] = arg
    if event == &#39;call&#39;:
      return original_trace_fn

  def trace_global(frame, event, arg):
    if event == &#39;call&#39;:
      info = inspect.getframeinfo(frame)
      info_parent = inspect.getframeinfo(frame.f_back)
      if info.function == f.__name__ and info_parent.function == &#39;hoisted_f__&#39;:
        return trace_local
  return trace_global


def hoist(f):

  @functools.wraps(f)
  def hoisted_f__(*args, **kwargs):
    original_trace_fn = sys.gettrace()

    results = {}
    trace_fn = make_trace(results, f, original_trace_fn)

    sys.settrace(trace_fn)
    f(*args, **kwargs)
    sys.settrace(original_trace_fn)

    return results

  return hoisted_f__
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>Refrigerator insight</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When looking through the food in your refrigerator, ask not &amp;ldquo;is this what I want to eat right now?&amp;rdquo;, ask &amp;ldquo;when do I want to eat this?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Python hoist()</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-16-python-hoist/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 16 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-16-python-hoist/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote a little decorator function called &lt;code&gt;hoist&lt;/code&gt;. Calling &lt;code&gt;hoist(f)&lt;/code&gt; transforms &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;, such that instead of returning the return value of &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;, it returns the values of all local variables in addition to the return value of &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;def f(x):
  y = x + 1
  z = y * 2
  return z + 1

f(4) == 11
hoist(f)(4) == {&#39;x&#39;: 4, &#39;y&#39;: 5, &#39;z&#39;: 10, &#39;return&#39;: 11}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sense? The result of &lt;code&gt;f(4)&lt;/code&gt; is just the return value, whereas &lt;code&gt;hoist(f)(4)&lt;/code&gt; gives the values of all local variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be a useful debugging tool, allowing access to the internal state of a function. It works by setting a trace function with Python&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;sys.settrace&lt;/code&gt;, as you can see in its definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the definition of &lt;code&gt;hoist&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;import inspect
import functools


class Collection(object):
  &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;The full set of variables over time.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;

  def __init__(self):
    self.values = {}

  def update(self, values):
    self.values.update(values)

  def set_return(self, arg):
    self.values[&#39;return&#39;] = arg

  def __repr__(self):
    return repr(self.values)


def make_trace(results, fn):
  def trace_local(frame, event, arg):
    # event: &#39;call&#39;, &#39;line&#39;, &#39;return&#39;, &#39;exception&#39; or &#39;opcode&#39;
    if event == &#39;line&#39;:
      arg_info = inspect.getargvalues(frame)
      results.update(arg_info.locals.copy())
    if event == &#39;return&#39;:
      arg_info = inspect.getargvalues(frame)
      values = arg_info.locals.copy()
      results.update(values)
      results.set_return(arg)
    if event == &#39;call&#39;:
      return fn

  def trace_global(frame, event, arg):
    if event == &#39;call&#39;:
      return trace_local
  return trace_global


def hoist(f):

  @functools.wraps(f)
  def new_f(*args, **kwargs):
    original_trace_fn = sys.gettrace()

    results = Collection()
    trace_fn = make_trace(results, original_trace_fn)

    sys.settrace(trace_fn)
    f(*args, **kwargs)
    sys.settrace(original_trace_fn)

    return results

  return new_f
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some ideas for extensions to &lt;code&gt;hoist&lt;/code&gt; follow. Feel free to go ahead and implement these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) Modify &lt;code&gt;hoist&lt;/code&gt; so the outputs are accessible via dot-notation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) Modify &lt;code&gt;hoist&lt;/code&gt; so it returns all values taken on by all variables during the execution of &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;.
Make it so that &lt;code&gt;hoist(f)(x)[&#39;value.3&#39;]&lt;/code&gt; returns the third value taken on by the variable &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; in the call to &lt;code&gt;f(x)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introducing Peer Learning Group</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-14-peer-learning-group/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 14 Jan 2021 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-14-peer-learning-group/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alright. I&amp;rsquo;ve been toying with this idea for months now. Perfection is the enemy of the good. It&amp;rsquo;s time to launch a peer learning experiment. Here we go.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello!
Peer Learning Group is an experiment for learning new things and meeting new people. And I&amp;rsquo;d love for you to join.
The experiment lasts for two weeks, and requires only a small time commitment during this period (just a few hours total).
During these two weeks, you will learn about several topics, and you will also teach the group about one or two topics yourself.
The first peer learning group session will be January 25 - February 7, 2021.
If this interests you, I encourage you to sign up here.
Additional details about &amp;ldquo;how it works&amp;rdquo; below the fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf32hojaa3E-v0w8jHXpLThnPJUAQrnFcRHk9kCuGW7pMQZeg/viewform?embedded=true&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;400&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; marginheight=&#34;0&#34; marginwidth=&#34;0&#34;&gt;Loading…&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-it-works&#34;&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 25, everyone will be added to a Facebook Messenger group chat. I&amp;rsquo;m targeting a group of about 6-8 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, I will be contacting everyone to learn what they are interested in learning about. I&amp;rsquo;ll coordinate with you to figure out 1 or 2 topics for you to teach the group about. These will be topics that someone &lt;em&gt;else&lt;/em&gt; in the group is interested in. We&amp;rsquo;ll also select a day for you to do the learning and teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the chosen day, you&amp;rsquo;ll be expected to spend about an hour learning about the selected topic, and sharing what you learn with the group chat. (You&amp;rsquo;re welcome to learn about the topic in advance, but that&amp;rsquo;s not required!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How you share what you&amp;rsquo;ve learned with the group is up to you, but the bar is low. There&amp;rsquo;s no expectation of putting together a lesson plan. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;m envisioning you &amp;ldquo;live tweeting&amp;rdquo; interesting things as you learn them, putting quotes, images, and explanations into the chat that you think communicate the main ideas clearly. But I&amp;rsquo;ll reiterate: how you share what you&amp;rsquo;ve learned is completely up to you, and we&amp;rsquo;re setting our expectations low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone else is welcome to discuss, ask questions, share insights, etc. The chat is there for you to use how you please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since an hour is a relatively short period of time, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to allocate topics to you that are at the fringes of your expertise already. My theory is that while an hour is fairly short, it will still be really rewarding to hear what someone else learns from a concentrated hour of study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the two week period, you&amp;rsquo;ll have &amp;ldquo;presented&amp;rdquo; once or twice, and collectively we&amp;rsquo;ll have learned about ~10 different topics in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to meet people and learn new things, and also to have fun. So come curious and with an open mind, and we&amp;rsquo;ll do our best to make this an interesting and enjoyable two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t do a lot of social media, and so over the holidays when I became active on several online discussion platforms simultaneously, I was a bit overwhelmed. I felt like I&amp;rsquo;d been plugged directly into the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, I enjoyed the conversation. I liked that there was always conversation happening. It skipped right over the step of &lt;em&gt;initiating&lt;/em&gt; a conversation, which requires an activation energy to cross. And it eliminated any need for &lt;em&gt;planning&lt;/em&gt; a conversation, which contributes to that activation energy requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it was like drinking from a firehose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already knew that there was 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/lWNhg9qyTlQ?t=93&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;more to see than can ever be seen&lt;/a&gt;, but this experience lead me to reckon with that fact in a more tangible way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I installed 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://getferdi.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ferdi&lt;/a&gt;, and loaded up all the old Slacks I&amp;rsquo;d ever been added to. I was able to log into both my Discord accounts simultaneously, and also discovered that there are &lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt; Discords about all sorts of things. Discourses too. And 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://nano.page&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;nano.page&lt;/a&gt;. Managed to mostly avoid Reddit. Signed into Gitter, which I previously rarely checked (so if you want to chat about Python Fire, join me 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitter.im/google/python-fire&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;!) On top of those, and all the messaging apps I was already using before, I also fell into reading 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-01-infinite-distractions-and-getting-a-good-sear/&#34;&gt;my six infinite distractions&lt;/a&gt; more often. There were now more channels of information coming in than I could simultaneously keep in my head. My computer and I both ran out of RAM. Needed a reboot and a new strategy for dealing with these channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The computer RAM issue turned out to be easier than the personal RAM one. Ferdi supports &amp;ldquo;hibernating&amp;rdquo; chat services when they&amp;rsquo;re not in use. My computer can now keep up with the chatter; I still can&amp;rsquo;t. 🤷‍♂️&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Limitations of Democratic Delegation-optional Voting</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-12-limitations-of-democratic-delegation-optional-voting/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 12 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-12-limitations-of-democratic-delegation-optional-voting/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-11-democratic-delegation-optional-voting/&#34;&gt;yesterday&amp;rsquo;s snippet&lt;/a&gt; I introduced the idea of &lt;em&gt;democratic delegation-optional voting&lt;/em&gt;. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t yet, read that first. Today, we&amp;rsquo;re going to be looking at its strengths and limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strengths&#34;&gt;Strengths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People can choose which issues matter most to them.&lt;/strong&gt; If an issue matters to you, you can vote on it directly. And so can all the people you convince to support your cause. You can do this even if your representatives disagree with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Representatives don&amp;rsquo;t need to be experts on everything.&lt;/strong&gt; If an issue is highly technical, representatives can delegate their constituents&#39; votes to someone who is a subject matter expert with similar values to the representative. If a voter doesn&amp;rsquo;t like the choice, they can make a different choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Residents don&amp;rsquo;t need to be experts on everything.&lt;/strong&gt; For most issues, most voters will delegate their votes to a Delegate. Residents can choose how much or how little time they want to spend researching individual issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Residents don&amp;rsquo;t need to trust their representatives for multiple years.&lt;/strong&gt; If a resident disagrees with their representative on even a single issue, they can make their vote and their voice count for that issue. They&amp;rsquo;re not stuck with a representative that only half represents them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power propagates to those who are trusted.&lt;/strong&gt; If people don&amp;rsquo;t like the way you&amp;rsquo;re voting, they can delegate their votes elsewhere. So, in order for a Delegate to keep their power, they need to keep the trust of their constituents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The system can be implemented incrementally, even for as little as a single issue.&lt;/strong&gt; It can be implemented incrementally on top of existing forms of governance such as the US government. Democratic Delegation-optional Voting doesn&amp;rsquo;t require explicit elected representatives for matters that require voting (elected representatives have other important responsibilities, so they aren&amp;rsquo;t going away entirely with this system!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DDoV can be used whenever the population of voters is well defined.&lt;/strong&gt; This makes it well suited both for running states and country legislatures, and for running school government or Prom Royalty elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The system is compatible with many existing forms of voting.&lt;/strong&gt; It works well with winner-take-all voting, ranked choice voting, approval voting, and proportional representation systems, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;limitations&#34;&gt;Limitations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DDoV requires a mechanism for Delegate&amp;rsquo;s votes to be made public.&lt;/strong&gt; This isn&amp;rsquo;t so hard to do, but it does need to be done in a timely manner in order to give people the opportunity to change their vote in the 48 hour period following the election deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A poor implementation could be prone to abuse of power by small Delegates.&lt;/strong&gt; How could this happen? If Delegates know how many ballots have been delegated to them, then a small Delegate could figure out whether or not a particular individual has delegated their votes to them. Of course, pressuring someone to delegate their vote to you is against the rules, but in many cases this would be hard to detect or enforce. To avoid this issue, a signature requirement (e.g. of 10 signatures from supporters who would use you as a default Delegate) could be required to become a Delegate. Once there&amp;rsquo;s this modest amount of public support for someone to become a Delegate, it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be possible for a Delegate to determine if an individual is delegating votes to them or not. Alternatively, information about how many ballots each Delegate has delegated to them could be only provided in an approximate form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduces the capacity for backroom deals and compromises.&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, so this might actually be a strength. Since power is more in the hands of the people, it becomes far more difficult for one party to exchange favors with another (&amp;ldquo;if you support xyz in bill A, I&amp;rsquo;ll support qrs in bill B.&amp;quot;) I think this strength and/or limitation requires further study.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Democratic Delegation-optional Voting</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-11-democratic-delegation-optional-voting/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-11-democratic-delegation-optional-voting/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this snippet I propose a novel voting system, which I call &amp;ldquo;Democratic Delegation-optional Voting&amp;rdquo;. The core idea of the voting system is that anyone can choose to delegate their vote to a group or individual that they trust. They may change their delegate selection at any time and for any reason (including for a brief period after votes are cast, as we will see), or they may choose to cast a vote themselves rather than delegating their vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-problem-does-this-voting-system-solve&#34;&gt;What problem does this voting system solve?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual voters don&amp;rsquo;t have enough time or energy to research every issue up for vote. So, delegation is crucial. At the same time, voters shouldn&amp;rsquo;t yield their power to delegates entirely. If a voter feels passionately about an issue, they should not have to hope their representative&amp;rsquo;s views align with theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-does-the-system-work&#34;&gt;How does the system work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahead of a Vote, an individual or organization can register themselves as a Delegate. They need only do this once even if there will be many Votes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On its own, a Delegate has no voting power. Each voter gets one ballot. Each voter may choose to cast that ballot themselves, or they may delegate their ballot to a Delegate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a Delegate may choose to cast its ballots itself, or it may choose to delegate them to another Delegate. If ten people have delegated their ballots to a Delegate, then it has ten times the voting power of an individual. A Delegate&amp;rsquo;s votes or delegation selections are public, whereas an individual&amp;rsquo;s votes or delegation selections are private.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Votes may be cast or a Delegate selected at any time leading up to a Vote deadline. Votes may be modified and Delegate selections may be changed up until this deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the Vote deadline arrives, votes and delegation-selections made by Delegates are made public. Delegates can no longer change their selections at this point. Individual voters then have an additional 48 hours following the Vote deadline during which they may choose to modify their ballot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system is flexible, in that it is compatible with winner-take-all voting, ranked choice voting, approval voting, proportional representation, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;toy-example-playground-election&#34;&gt;Toy Example: Playground Election&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now demonstrate the voting system in a playground setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaron, Brianna, Chloe, Daniel, and Emily are playing on the playground. Aaron and Brianna both want to use the swing. There&amp;rsquo;s only one swing. &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s vote!&amp;rdquo; suggests Emily. &amp;ldquo;Whoever gets more votes gets to swing.&amp;rdquo; Aaron and Brianna agree: whoever gets three or more votes wins. Daniel shrugs. &amp;ldquo;Chloe can have my vote!&amp;rdquo; he shouts, and he runs off to play alone on the seesaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Aaron, Brianna, Chloe and Emily each vote: Aaron and Brianna each for themselves, Chloe for Aaron and Emily for Brianna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So Aaron wins, 3-2, since Chloe&amp;rsquo;s vote also counts for Daniel!&amp;rdquo; Emily shouts. She&amp;rsquo;s really getting into this election thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just then Daniel comes tearing around the corner. &amp;ldquo;Wait! I thought you were going to vote for Brianna&amp;rdquo;, he tells Chloe. &amp;ldquo;Can I change my vote?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily, having studied &lt;em&gt;Democratic Delegation-optional Voting&lt;/em&gt; says &amp;ldquo;Sure, no trouble. Anyone else?&amp;rdquo; Hearing no other vote-changes, she proclaims Brianna the winner, and Aaron spends the rest of recess helping push Brianna higher on the swing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;another-example-local-and-state-legislation&#34;&gt;Another Example: Local and State Legislation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this example, consider a hypothetical local government and state government both using &lt;em&gt;Democratic Delegation-optional Voting&lt;/em&gt;. Over the next two weeks, the local government will be voting on two issues (the school budget and a commercial cannabis restriction ordinance), and the state government will also be voting on two issues (an unpopular jaywalking penalty and an obscure contract law thingy that affects very few people and is hard to understand).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the residents have set up simple &lt;em&gt;rules&lt;/em&gt; for choosing default Delegates. Several republican residents, they have selected their local republican Delegate as their default Delegate, and similarly several democratic residents have selected the local democratic Delegate as their default Delegate. Some residents have a rule-based system, where e.g. education-related issues are delegated to one Delegate while penal code issues are delegated to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vote deadlines are set as follows, and the text of each issue is made available to the public two weeks prior to its Vote deadline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local school budget: January 21, 2021&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State unpopular jaywalking penalty: January 22, 2021&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local commercial cannabis restriction ordinance: January 28, 2021&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State obscure contract law thingy that affects very few people and is hard to understand: January 29, 2021&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the residents hear about the unpopular jaywalking penalty, and they see how awful an idea it is, and so they directly submit a Nay vote on that issue. The penalty is overwhelmingly voted down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school budget is a popular but particularly nuanced issue. While many residents chose to vote on it directly, we also see many residents choose a Delegate that they trust with school board issues, since they know this vote is important but complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many people, the commercial cannabis restriction ordinance is an important issue too, but they trust their default Delegate will vote appropriately. The day after the election they&amp;rsquo;re surprised to read on their social media newsfeed of choice that one of the common default Delegates didn&amp;rsquo;t vote as expected, so they double check their vote. The vote looks fine. Clickbait post, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the residents don&amp;rsquo;t care about the obscure contract law thingy that affects very few people and is hard to understand, and so they leave their default Delegate selected. Some of the common default Delegates also don&amp;rsquo;t have time for obscure contract law, and so they choose to delegate their votes to still further, more specialized Delegates that they trust. (This is good because not only do most voters not have time to look into contract law, they also don&amp;rsquo;t have time to look into people who do have time to look into contract law, so they trust their Delegate to do &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;.) Most of the voters are fine with how their vote ends up being cast, though a few don&amp;rsquo;t like the sub-Delegate their default-Delegate chose, and so those few can change their vote if they like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all cases, the final votes are in and the election is tallied 48 hours after the election deadline. The school budget passes. The jaywalking penalty is voted down. The commercial cannabis restriction ordinance will go into effect immediately. And the obscure contract law thingy that affects very few people and is hard to understand&amp;hellip; well, to be honest I didn&amp;rsquo;t really follow that one too closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-observations&#34;&gt;Some observations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve seen the &lt;em&gt;Democratic Delegation-optional Voting&lt;/em&gt; in action now. It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;democratic&amp;rdquo;, because it gives everyone an equal voice in every election. Everyone gets precisely one vote. It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;delegation-optional&amp;rdquo; because voters and Delegates alike have the choice of whether to vote directly, delegate their vote, or even skip voting altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll notice that there are no explicit elected representatives in this system. There are merely different degrees of being an elected representative (the number of ballots you are responsible for as a Delegate). Anyone can register as a Delegate, and whether you make this a full-time job, investigating every single issue on the table, or whether you often delegate your votes further is up to you as a Delegate. Under this system, some common Delegates will be responsible for casting huge numbers of votes, while other Delegates will be responsible for casting just a handful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned that either an individual or an organization can register as a Delegate. If an organization registers as a Delegate they can select their votes through whatever process they choose (e.g. an internal election is fair game), and they are held to the same deadlines as every other Delegate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-edge-cases-and-minor-details&#34;&gt;Some edge-cases and minor details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the Local and State Legislation example, a voter can set up simple rules for selecting their default Delegate. The voting system can also be extended to allow a voter to additionally specify &amp;ldquo;fall-through&amp;rdquo; backup Delegates. A ballot is given to a fall-through Delegate in the case that a voter&amp;rsquo;s higher-priority Delegate does not take an action on a particular piece of legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if a major Delegate delegates their ballots to a trusted specialized delegate, but isn&amp;rsquo;t happy with how that trusted specialized delegate votes? They can contact their constituents and let them know. The constituents will have 48 hours during which they can change their vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if a Delegate A delegates their ballots to Delegate B, and Delegate B delegates their ballots to Delegate A? This should be easy to avoid in practice, because I expect Delegates will naturally have clear roles / specializations. Should it occur, however, no vote will be cast for voters delegating their ballot to those Delegates (unless a voter listed a backup Delegate), and the voters will have the usual 48 hours during which to place their vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Democratic Delegation-optional Voting&lt;/em&gt; truly puts governance in the hands of the people, without needing everyone to be an expert on everything. It makes Delegates accountable to their constituents, because a constituent can change their Delegates at any time. It allows people to perform their civic duty to precisely the extent that is appropriate for them. On the issues that matter most to them, they can cast an explicit vote. For the majority of issues, though, individuals don&amp;rsquo;t need to learn the details of every piece of legislation. They have the option to trust those to their Delegates.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A filesystem for social media</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-10-a-filesystem-for-social-media/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 10 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-10-a-filesystem-for-social-media/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://omar.website/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Omar Riswan&lt;/a&gt; has an excellent project called 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://omar.website/tabfs/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;TabFS&lt;/a&gt; that takes your browser tabs and exposes them to you as a filesystem. When you run &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt;, you see a list of all your open tabs. &lt;code&gt;rm&lt;/code&gt; on a tab directory closes the tab. Inspecting the tab with standard tools (&lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rm&lt;/code&gt;, etc) allow you to do things like reading the title or contents of the tab (yes, the whole tab&amp;rsquo;s contents!), closing the tab, or running javascript in the tab. The whole thing is quite clever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by TabFS, I envision another non-conventional filesystem: Social Media FS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you mount smfs and authenticate with your social media providers. Then if you &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; the mounted directory, you can see each of the places you can read from and write to on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a directory full of your chat threads. The timestamps indicate when they were created and when they were most recently modified. You can read the contents of the chat, or send a new message just as easily (and via the same tools) as you would write a file to disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a directory of all the Facebook posts made by all your friends and all the groups you follow. Each post has a file with its contents, and also one with all the comments and reactions to it. You can make a new post or add a new comment the same way you&amp;rsquo;d make a new file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use standard tools for monitoring for new content. I like to use 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pythonhosted.org/watchdog/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Python&amp;rsquo;s watchdog&lt;/a&gt; for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a directory for ads too, which you&amp;rsquo;re welcome to peruse or delete as you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reacting to a twitter post, sending a DM, receiving discord or slack or signal messages&amp;hellip; all of these are organized as files and folders, and actions can be performed simply through file reads and writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d sure love to use a filesystem like this, and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/bieber-bot/&#34;&gt;Bieber Bot&lt;/a&gt; would too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mobile Distraction Detection, at last</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-09-mobile-distraction-detection-at-last/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 09 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-09-mobile-distraction-detection-at-last/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have implemented a minimal working version of mobile &lt;em&gt;distraction detection&lt;/em&gt;, complete with a simple intervention for when I visit distracting websites on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-does-distraction-detection-do&#34;&gt;What does &amp;ldquo;distraction detection&amp;rdquo; do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It runs on my laptop and monitors my &lt;em&gt;phone&lt;/em&gt; for when I visit distracting websites. I give it a list of distracting websites for it to keep an eye out for. My list is: twitter, facebook, hacker news, google news, reddit, and youtube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can set it to perform some action whenever I&amp;rsquo;m on one of these websites. For this first iteration, I&amp;rsquo;m having Bieber Bot message me whenever it notices I&amp;rsquo;m on one of these websites. Now that it&amp;rsquo;s working though, it will be easy to customize to my liking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In future iterations, I&amp;rsquo;ll have it wait until I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending several minutes on the website before messaging me, and I&amp;rsquo;ll only have it do this during times when I mean to be focused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-is-this-interesting&#34;&gt;Why is this interesting?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are excellent browser extensions that help you take control of your browsing habits on your computer. I recommend DK&amp;rsquo;s 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://getintention.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Intention&lt;/a&gt; for this. However, there aren&amp;rsquo;t great solutions like Intention for mobile browsing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge is that mobile browsers don&amp;rsquo;t provide good ways for developers to write extensions. I&amp;rsquo;ve built my mobile distraction detector in spite of this limitation :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-does-it-work&#34;&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use an iPhone and the Chrome browser. I&amp;rsquo;m logged into my Google Account on Chrome on both my phone and my laptop, and I have tab syncing turned on. With tab syncing, all my tab sessions from my phone are synced to my Google account, and are visible on my laptop, usually with a sub-minute latency. You can view this data in human-readable form at 
&lt;a href=&#34;chrome://history/syncedTabs&#34;&gt;chrome://history/syncedTabs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tab session data is stored along with the rest of my Chrome data. Since I use a Mac, the path is &lt;code&gt;~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Profile\ 1/Sync\ Data/LevelDB/&lt;/code&gt;. Note that &amp;ldquo;Profile 1&amp;rdquo; may be replaced with either &amp;ldquo;Default&amp;rdquo;, or the name of your Profile, depending on how many Google accounts you have connected with Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data is stored in a LevelDB database (this is unusual for Chrome; most of the rest of your Chrome data is stored in sqlite3 databases). LevelDB is an efficient key-value store, which was written by Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat back in 2011. The keys which contain the synced tab data are those prefixed with &amp;ldquo;session-dt&amp;rdquo;. The corresponding values are &lt;code&gt;SessionSpecifics&lt;/code&gt; protocol buffers. 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/&amp;#43;/master:components/sync/protocol/session_specifics.proto&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The protocol buffer definition is available here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before parsing the sync data, I always make a copy of it first, and then I only ever open the copy. This ensures that Chrome doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a lock on the database, and isn&amp;rsquo;t editing it concurrently with my own program reading it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use the Python library &lt;code&gt;plyvel&lt;/code&gt; to parse the LevelDB database: &lt;code&gt;db = plyvel.DB(path_to_copy_of_leveldb_directory)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to use the protobuf definition, I compiled it first with protoc: &lt;code&gt;protoc -I chromium/ chromium/components/sync/protocol/*.proto --python_out=dbieber/distraction_detection/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting these pieces together, accessing the session data looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;import plyvel
from components.sync.protocol import session_specifics_pb2

db = plyvel.DB(path)

for key, value in db.iterator():
  if b&#39;sessions-dt&#39; in key:
	session = session_specifics_pb2.SessionSpecifics.FromString(value)

db.close()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, the key remaining piece to understand is how to figure out which tabs are open on which devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the SessionSpecifics protos has an attribute: &lt;code&gt;session_tag&lt;/code&gt; which uniquely identifies a session. For each &lt;code&gt;session_tag&lt;/code&gt;, there is a single SessionSpecifics proto with a &lt;code&gt;client_name&lt;/code&gt; attribute: this indicates which device the session lives on. Each of the remaining SessionSpecifics protos with that same tag correspond to a single tab, and the currently open URL for that tab comes from &lt;code&gt;session.tab.navigation[-1].virtual_url&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, it&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of matching the URLs against my list of distracting websites, and sending the data off to Bieber Bot. Distractions, detected. :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-next&#34;&gt;What next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll tweak my own distraction detection setup to something that makes sense for me. Instead of immediate messages from Bieber Bot, I&amp;rsquo;ll have him try to keep my total senseless scrolling for a day to a moderate amount. I&amp;rsquo;ll have him be particularly vigilant about helping me keep my morning scrolling from going on too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll also send this snippet around to folks interested in building similar tools. While I won&amp;rsquo;t be turning this into a product for the masses, I&amp;rsquo;m hopeful that the method does get picked up by projects like Intention, ActivityWatch, and other tools that aim to help people maintain healthy browsing habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s common knowledge that with account syncing, rich data about your mobile browsing is available on your computer. So today, there isn&amp;rsquo;t much tooling that takes advantage of this. If you work on a product in this space, well, now you&amp;rsquo;ve had a glimpse of what data&amp;rsquo;s available and what it can do. Consider using this approach to extend the reach of your product.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/post/2021-01-08-where-are-all-the-posts-from-2020/&#34;&gt;linked to the snippets section from my main website&lt;/a&gt;, will it be harder to write snippets? I hope not. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to make an even more concerted effort to lower the quality bar though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal, as always, is for the snippets section to avoid any inhibitions. Writing here should be as easy as thinking aloud. A tiny post like this ought to help in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Distraction detection: Proto acquired!</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-08-distraction-detection-proto-acquired/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-08-distraction-detection-proto-acquired/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;strong&gt;inching&lt;/strong&gt; my way toward writing a distraction detector that will allow Bieber Bot to notice when I&amp;rsquo;m distracted on my phone and stage an intervention. (Wow!, I first pitched this idea (to myself) 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2019-12-30-analyzing-my-browser-history/&#34;&gt;in one of my very first snippets&lt;/a&gt;, back in 2019.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most recently 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-01-programmatically-accessing-chromes-tabs-from-other-devices-data/&#34;&gt;I figured out where Chrome&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Tabs from other devices&amp;rdquo; data is stored&lt;/a&gt;. However, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t parse the data because I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what the protocol buffer definition being used was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I heard back from someone who works on Chrome. I&amp;rsquo;ve acquired the proto definitions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/&amp;#43;/master:components/sync/protocol/session_specifics.proto&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;proto definitions are here&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/&amp;#43;/master:components/sync_sessions/session_store.cc&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;the code that persists the data to disk is here&lt;/a&gt;. I can successfully bulid the protos (using protoc) and I can parse my session data from the leveldb database. Progress!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble now is my phone seems to have stopped syncing its tabs two days ago. Weird! One more mystery to solve I guess&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A social network for slow long-form discussions</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-07-a-social-network-for-slow-long-form-discussions/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 07 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-07-a-social-network-for-slow-long-form-discussions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A social network&amp;rsquo;s design influences the conversations that people will have on it. Can we design a social network that will facilitate healthy debate and discussion, while avoiding toxic discourse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this: a variant of Twitter where instead of a 140 character maximum, there&amp;rsquo;s a 1400 word maximum. (We could also impose a 140 character minimum?) And you&amp;rsquo;re limited to just 3 posts per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real twist though? All posts are posted at the same time: at 8am, 2pm, 8pm, and 2am. We choose times scatter across the day so your timezone doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, scrap the reference to Twitter altogether. The feel I&amp;rsquo;m going for is discussion focused, not shouting-into-the-void focused. So, think Reddit with all these weird limitations tacked on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hope is that having infrequent postings gives people a chance to breathe: no one&amp;rsquo;s expecting a response in seconds or minutes. The hope is that this also gives people a chance to think; this can be a place where long-form well thought out discussion takes place. And the hope is also this rate-limited schedule eliminates any of the infinite-scroll / endless-refreshing that comes with existing popular social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think it could work? I think it could.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Brains Don&#39;t Do Solomonoff Induction</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-06-brains-dont-do-solomonoff-induction/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-06-brains-dont-do-solomonoff-induction/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://zhat.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dan Abolafia&lt;/a&gt; asked me some thought provoking questions about Solomonoff Induction and intelligence. This snippet comes from my answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question: Do you think a person has a hypothesis space and prior that are fixed at the moment of birth and never change over the course of the person&amp;rsquo;s life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tl;dr Nope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different levels at which you can define hypothesis space. Consider two statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statement [1]: People learn and change their prior over hypotheses based on their observations and experiences over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In statement [1] (which I hope is unobjectionably true), &amp;ldquo;hypotheses&amp;rdquo; refers to hypotheses that will be formed during a person&amp;rsquo;s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person&amp;rsquo;s belief about their hypotheses can change in response to new information. This can be done in a Bayesian way, using as a prior at any particular moment their beliefs from before gaining that new information. When they gain new information, they apply Bayesian inference to compute the posterior. The posterior becomes the new prior for the next time new information is obtained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also &amp;ldquo;refactor&amp;rdquo; statement [1] to instead read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statement [2]: The &amp;lsquo;computation that a person embodies&amp;rsquo; is fixed at birth.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] and [2] are completely consistent with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Let me know if the term &amp;lsquo;computation that a person embodies&amp;rsquo; needs clarifying.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of [2], a person has a single prior over &amp;ldquo;hypotheses&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Or more precisely: a person has a single &amp;ldquo;hypothesis&amp;rdquo;, which came from a single prior. But the person didn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;lsquo;have&amp;rsquo; that prior; instead, the process by which they were created did.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here a &amp;ldquo;hypothesis&amp;rdquo; is a much larger thing than in [1]. It&amp;rsquo;s the complete manner in which the person will determine how to respond to inputs over the course of their life. (That is, it&amp;rsquo;s the &amp;lsquo;computation that the person embodies&amp;rsquo;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting question to ask whether these hypotheses come from something that approximates Solomonoff induction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the &amp;ldquo;brain approximating Solomonoff induction&amp;rdquo; original question &amp;ndash; rather, it would be more like &amp;ldquo;evolution approximating Solomonoff induction&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Aside: And to answer this question: I don&amp;rsquo;t think single reward minimization is the most natural way to model what these complex physical processes are doing; there are lots of competing forces at play. So even though you could in principle distill them to a single reward function, I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s the most useful way of modeling things of this complexity and scale. Update: now that I have a better understanding of Solomonoff induction, I see how this doesn&amp;rsquo;t answer the question.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the answer to the main question is No, there needs to be an extra-Bayesian method for choosing priors and hypothesis spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s return to perspective [1]. At any given time, a person might have some beliefs about the world. Then they acquire new information. They update their beliefs. This in principle can be done in a Bayesian way all throughout ones life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, there need to be other processes at work, because people develop new concepts, choose to think about some things more than others, forget stuff, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with infinite memory and infinitely fast compute, an agent could in principle start with all possible concepts, and just keep doing Bayesian updates throughout their life, and I think such an agent would do quite well for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: for a hypothetical agent like this, the answer to the original question would be Yes. But agents like this don&amp;rsquo;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agree or disagree: The brain samples hypotheses from a universal unchanging prior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This I disagree with. I hope perspective [1] clarifies why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any action that the brain takes, such as sampling a hypothesis, is happening during an individual&amp;rsquo;s life. Of course it&amp;rsquo;s going to take into account all the experiences of the individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could of course mean &amp;ldquo;hypothesis&amp;rdquo; in the sense of [2], where the complete life experiences of the individual are inputs to the hypothesis. But then why wait until there&amp;rsquo;s a brain at all to sample the hypothesis? Now we&amp;rsquo;re talking about a hypothesis (the &amp;lsquo;computation that the person embodies&amp;rsquo;) that has been in existence at least since the person&amp;rsquo;s birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think [1] and [2] are equivalent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think they are two ways of describing the same situation. So, in that sense, yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could see why people might disagree with this though. People can make good arguments that you&amp;rsquo;re not just a fixed embodied computation. I think these arguments are wrong, but people can still make them. These hypothetical people would regard [1] as correct and [2] as incorrect, whereas I think both [1] and [2] are correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bayesian inference doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide a way to create or destroy hypotheses. It merely provides a way for updating one&amp;rsquo;s beliefs about existing hypotheses. How do you reconcile this with [1] and [2]?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is right. Hypotheses can&amp;rsquo;t be &amp;ldquo;formed&amp;rdquo; from Bayesian inference. As I was describing perspective [1], I was envisioning hypotheses being formed in some (likely extra-Bayesian, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t important) way and merely being updated via Bayesian inference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Aside: How are these hypotheses formed though?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, if you already have a prior for the state of the universe, then you might (1) make a determination about what variables are relevant to the situation, and (2) marginalize out all other variables. No need to do this though if memory and compute aren&amp;rsquo;t limited.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s return to perspective [1]. At any given time, a person might have some beliefs about the world. Then they acquire new information. They update their beliefs. This in principle can be done in a Bayesian way all throughout ones life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does this work, you ask?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It relies on the agent starting with a prior over all possible hypotheses. This avoids the issue of needing to create hypotheses along the way, which Bayesian inference doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide a mechanism for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to describe this by the following text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With infinite memory and infinitely fast compute, an agent could in principle start with all possible concepts, and just keep doing Bayesian updates throughout their life, and I think such an agent would do quite well for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I understand correctly, this &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; (more or less) Solomonoff induction. (I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize this at the start of the conversation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve started with a universal prior and applied bayesian inference to update it as we made observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this isn&amp;rsquo;t what people do. So, my answer to the overall initial question is just a simple &amp;ldquo;Nope.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;turn a collection of photos into a slide show&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set it to music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add gentle transitions, like a slow pan of the camera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fade the music in and out to change songs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;given a file of time stamp ranges, clip to just those parts of the file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;given a file of timestamp ranges, each with a speed multiplier, adjust the speed of each clip and stitch together the clips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have code that does this last one already, but I suspect it can be orders of magnitude faster done as an ffmpeg command compared with the way I&amp;rsquo;m doing it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;turn-a-collection-of-photos-into-a-slide-show&#34;&gt;Turn a collection of photos into a slide show:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;ffmpeg \
  -r 1/5 \
  -pattern_type glob -i &amp;quot;/Users/dbieber/Documents/video/raw/*.png&amp;quot; \
  -c:v libx264 \
  -r 30 \
  -pix_fmt yuv420p \
  output.mp4
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up, I&amp;rsquo;ll see if I can add some audio, and I&amp;rsquo;ll work my way down the list.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>More Datalog Queries for Roam</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-04-more-datalog-queries-for-roam/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-04-more-datalog-queries-for-roam/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this snippet I share datalog queries for Roam Research. For more such queries (and to see how to run these queries), 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-22-datalog-queries-for-roam-research/&#34;&gt;see this earlier snippet on the subject&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pages-tagged-with-x-not-listed-on-page-y&#34;&gt;Pages tagged with &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo; not listed on page &amp;ldquo;Y&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This query is useful when constructing an index page. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you want to take all the pages you&amp;rsquo;ve tagged with &amp;ldquo;[[Brilliant Idea]]&amp;rdquo; and organize them on a page called &amp;ldquo;[[Brilliant Ideas Index]]&amp;rdquo;. This query will find you all the pages that are tagged with &amp;ldquo;[[Brilliant Idea]]&amp;rdquo; that haven&amp;rsquo;t yet been added to the &amp;ldquo;[[Brilliant Ideas Index]]&amp;rdquo; page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;let container = &amp;quot;Brilliant Ideas Index&amp;quot;;
let tag = &amp;quot;Brilliant&amp;quot;;
let ancestor = `[ 
  [(ancestor ?child ?parent)
   [?parent :block/children ?child]]
  [(ancestor ?child ?ancestor)
   [?parent :block/children ?child]
   (ancestor ?parent ?ancestor)]
]`;

var blocks = window.roamAlphaAPI.q(`
[:find ?page_title
  :in $ % ?container_title ?tag_text
  :where 
    [?container_page :node/title ?container_title]
    [?page :node/title ?page_title]
    (ancestor ?tagged_block ?page)
    [?tagged_block :block/refs ?tag_page]
    [?tag_page :node/title ?tag_text]
    (not (ancestor ?container_block ?container_page)
         [?container_block :block/refs ?page])
]`, ancestor, container, tag)

console.log(blocks.map((data, index) =&amp;gt; {return `[[${data[0]}]]`}).join(&#39;\n&#39;));
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope this is useful for getting your Roam graph organized!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blocks-tagged-with-both-x-and-y&#34;&gt;Blocks tagged with both &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Y&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use a query like this to find blocks tagged with both &amp;ldquo;Snippets&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;ok-to-publish&amp;rdquo;, in order to automatically publish snippets to my website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;let tag1 = &amp;quot;Snippets&amp;quot;;
let tag2 = &amp;quot;ok-to-publish&amp;quot;;
var blocks = window.roamAlphaAPI.q(`[
	:find ?uid ?string
	:in $ ?tag1 ?tag2
	:where
	[?block :block/uid ?uid]
	[?block :block/string ?string]
	[?block :block/refs ?block_tag1]
	[?block :block/refs ?block_tag2]
	[?block_tag1 :node/title ?tag1]
	[?block_tag2 :node/title ?tag2]
]`, tag1, tag2);

blocks.map(
  (data, index) =&amp;gt; {return `((${data[0]})): ${data[1]}`;})
.join(&#39;\n&#39;);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;info-about-all-children-of-any-block-tagged-with-both-x-and-y&#34;&gt;Info about all children of any block tagged with both &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Y&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This extends the previous query in two key ways: (1) it gets all children of any block with both tags, and (2) it gets more detailed information about those children. The ?uid indicates which block has the two target tags, while the ?child_uid, ?parent_uid, and ?order fields allow for reconstructing the arrangement of the child blocks. Each returned record has the text of a child block, it&amp;rsquo;s uid (?child_uid), it&amp;rsquo;s parent&amp;rsquo;s uid (?parent_uid), and the order of that child in its parent&amp;rsquo;s list of children. Together, this information allows you to fully reconstruct the tree of blocks beneath each of the tagged blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;let tag1 = &amp;quot;Snippets&amp;quot;;
let tag2 = &amp;quot;ok-to-publish&amp;quot;;
let ancestor = `[ 
  [(ancestor ?child ?parent)
   [?parent :block/children ?child]]
  [(ancestor ?child ?ancestor)
   [?parent :block/children ?child]
   (ancestor ?parent ?ancestor)]
]`;

let block_info = window.roamAlphaAPI.q(`[
  :find ?uid ?child_text ?child_uid ?parent_uid ?order
  :in $ % ?tag1 ?tag2
  :where
  [?block :block/uid ?uid]
  [?block :block/string ?string]
  [?block :block/refs ?block_tag1]
  [?block :block/refs ?block_tag2]
  [?block_tag1 :node/title ?tag1]
  [?block_tag2 :node/title ?tag2]
  (ancestor ?child ?block)
  [?parent :block/children ?child]
  [?parent :block/uid ?parent_uid]
  [?child :block/uid ?child_uid]
  [?child :block/order ?order]
  [?child :block/string ?child_text]
]`, ancestor, tag1, tag2);

block_info.map(
  (data, index) =&amp;gt; {return `((${data[0]})) ${data[1]}`;})
.join(&#39;\n&#39;);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use the following script to organize the blocks by their parent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;class DefaultDict {
  constructor(defaultInit) {
    return new Proxy({}, {
      get: (target, name) =&amp;gt; name in target ?
        target[name] :
        (target[name] = typeof defaultInit === &#39;function&#39; ?
          new defaultInit().valueOf() :
          defaultInit)
    })
  }
}

var blocks_by_parent = new DefaultDict(Array);
block_info.forEach(
  (info) =&amp;gt; {
    [uid, child_text, child_uid, parent_uid, order] = info;
    blocks_by_parent[parent_uid].push(info);
  }
);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the following function &lt;code&gt;blocksInOrder&lt;/code&gt; to place the children in their proper order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;function blocksInOrder(blocks_by_parent, uid) {
  var blocks = [];
  var blocks_list = blocks_by_parent[uid].sort(
    (b1, b2) =&amp;gt; {return b1[4] - b2[4];}
  );
  blocks_list.forEach((block) =&amp;gt; {
    blocks.push(block)
    blocks.push(...blocksInOrder(blocks_by_parent, block[2]));
  });
  return blocks;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>Spaced Repetition in Roam Research</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-02-spaced-repetition-in-roam-research/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-02-spaced-repetition-in-roam-research/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to do spaced repetition in Roam Research. This post describes mine. I was inspired to start this two months ago by reading 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ncase.me/remember/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Nicky Case&amp;rsquo;s comic on spaced repetition&lt;/a&gt;, and I highly recommend the read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Spaced repetition&amp;rdquo; just means studying flashcards, studying the cards you know best less often, and study the cards you struggle with more often. It&amp;rsquo;s a powerful technique for learning and remembering material, whether you&amp;rsquo;re a student or a lifelong learner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system I use is based on a classic system called the &amp;ldquo;Leitner Box&amp;rdquo; method. I&amp;rsquo;ll first describe how to use the &amp;ldquo;Leitner Box&amp;rdquo; approach in Roam, and then I&amp;rsquo;ll describe the adjustments I made to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-a-leitner-box&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;Leitner Box&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &amp;ldquo;Leitner Box&amp;rdquo; system of spaced repetition, there are seven boxes numbered Box 1 through Box 7. When you create a flashcard, you place it into Box 1. Every day, you use a schedule to determine which boxes of cards to review. The cards in box 1 get reviewed most often, and the cards in box 7 get reviewed least often. When you review a card, you move it up a box (e.g. from box 1 to 2 or from box 4 to 5) if you get the card right. But if you get a card wrong, you move the card back to box 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default Leitner Box schedule looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fplayground%2FpW7FsufOIr.png?alt=media&amp;amp;token=3cbd07b1-11e5-4389-896d-9a181f6529fc&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you read this schedule?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The colored circles represent the different Leitner Boxes. The red circles represent Box 1, the orange circles represent Box 2, the yellow circles represent Box 3, all the way up to the final pink circle that represents Box 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The numbers along the bottom are &amp;ldquo;session numbers&amp;rdquo;. For your first review session, you look at the circles above &amp;ldquo;01&amp;rdquo; (Boxes 2 and 1). For your second review session, you look at the circles above &amp;ldquo;02&amp;rdquo; (Boxes 3 and 1). Always review boxes for a given day in order from highest to lowest. After completing session &amp;ldquo;64&amp;rdquo;, the schedule wraps around and your next session is session &amp;ldquo;01&amp;rdquo; again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To recap, (1) you put new flashcards into Box 1. (2) When you get a card correct, you move it up a box. (3) When you get a card incorrect, you move it all the way back to Box 1. (4) You use the schedule made of colored dots to decide which boxes to review each day, answering questions in higher boxes first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;setting-up-leitner-boxes-in-roam&#34;&gt;Setting up Leitner Boxes in Roam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This system is all well and good. How do we put it into practice? Here I&amp;rsquo;ll quickly describe (1) getting set up, (2) creating new flashcards, and (3) how to do a review session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setting up:&lt;/strong&gt; You can use my template; simply copy and paste the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pastebin.com/GPfhcUug&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;raw&amp;rdquo; text at the bottom of the page here&lt;/a&gt; into Roam Research, e.g. onto a new page named &amp;ldquo;Spaced Repetition&amp;rdquo;. For this to work you need to copy from the region that says &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;RAW paste data&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;. You can 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pastebin.com/zvjFKZAb&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;get the enhanced template (recommended; see below) here&lt;/a&gt;. Again, be sure to copy from the region that says &amp;ldquo;RAW paste data&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default template creates a page for each of the seven Leitner boxes. It also puts the default schedule on the page, and gives you a place to keep track of what session number you&amp;rsquo;re up to. It will also add two questions to your Leitner Box 1 (one about avocados, and one about Cloze deletions), and includes some basic instructions for how to do spaced repetition in Roam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating New Flashcards:&lt;/strong&gt; You can create a new card anywhere in your Roam graph simply by tagging a note with &amp;ldquo;#[[Leitner Box 1]]&amp;rdquo;. Here are two ways to create cards in Roam:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put the question on one bullet, and put the answer in the child bullets. Then tag the bullet with the question with &amp;ldquo;#[[Leitner Box 1]]&amp;rdquo; to add it to your spaced repetition system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use the syntax {{=: question | answer}} in Roam to create text that remains hidden until clicked. The text &amp;ldquo;answer&amp;rdquo; wont appear until you click on the text &amp;ldquo;question.&amp;rdquo; Again, tag the line with &amp;ldquo;#[[Leitner Box 1]]&amp;rdquo; to add it to your spaced repetition system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend you 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;read Andy Matuschak&amp;rsquo;s notes on &amp;ldquo;How to write good prompts&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; for tips on how to create good flashcards. 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ncase.me/remember/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Nicky Case&amp;rsquo;s comic: &amp;ldquo;How to Remember Anything Forever-ish&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; also has good suggestions for how to create good questions for spaced repetition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to do a Review Session:&lt;/strong&gt; Visit your &amp;ldquo;Spaced Repetition&amp;rdquo; page to figure out what session number to do. Increment the session number, and use the schedule to determine which Leitner boxes you&amp;rsquo;ll be looking at in this session. Remember, do the Leitner boxes in decreasing order of their number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each Leitner box, visit its page in Roam. All your questions will appear in the Linked References section of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go through the questions one by one. If you get the answer correct, increment the box number by 1. If you get the answer incorrect or struggle with it, set the tag back to &amp;ldquo;#[[Leitner Box 1]]&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about sending things back to box 1; you&amp;rsquo;ll see those questions very often and soon they&amp;rsquo;ll be back in the higher numbered boxes again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;enhancements-beyond-the-default-system&#34;&gt;Enhancements Beyond the Default System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve made several changes to the default Leitner Box system to improve it to my taste. You&amp;rsquo;re welcome to use them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leitner Boxes 0 and $\infty$:&lt;/strong&gt; I use an extra box, &amp;ldquo;Leitner Box 0&amp;rdquo; for flashcards that I&amp;rsquo;m not ready to put into my rotation yet. I try to only add at most 10 cards a day to keep the total review workload low. If I have more cards than this, I keep them in Box 0 until I&amp;rsquo;m ready to start studying them, at which point I move them to Box 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leitner Box $\infty$ is for cards that have graduated from Box 7. In theory, I will remember these cards for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra box 5s, 6s, and 7s:&lt;/strong&gt; I have decided to create two Box 5s (named 5A and 5B), four Box 6s (6A, 6B, 6C, and 6D), and eight Box 7s (7A through 7H). This prevents any individual review session from accumulating too many cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran a simulation and under the default system, adding 10 new cards a day and getting 95% of cards correct, some review sessions will require reviewing over 700 cards! Under the enhanced system, the longest review session will only ever be 140 cards (and most review sessions are much shorter than that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the modified schedule that allows me to use these extra boxes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fplayground%2F_dSM-MMp85.png?alt=media&amp;amp;token=b3682748-8ea4-4444-97df-0c4592beb1ff&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fplayground%2FhFRPfzGpwy.png?alt=media&amp;amp;token=20b7f689-4117-4901-a806-846b0d099d7d&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use this enhanced schedule, first use the review session number to figure out which column of colored circles to look at. As before, a red circle indicates Leitner Box 1, a yellow circle indicates Leitner Box 2, etc. If the circle has a letter inside it, that means to review that particular variant of the box. E.g. a blue circle with a &amp;ldquo;B&amp;rdquo; inside means to review Leitner box 5B. The arrow to the right of a box indicates which box you should move the card to if you get it correct. E.g. in review session &amp;ldquo;51&amp;rdquo; you should review box 5B and move correct cards to box 6D; you should then review boxes 2 and 1 as usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embed the box list:&lt;/strong&gt; I use Roam Research&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;embed block&amp;rdquo; feature to embed a list of all Leitner Boxes onto all my Leitner Box pages. This makes it easy to quickly navigate from any box to any other box. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t think of a good way to include this in the template, so you&amp;rsquo;ll have to add this yourself if you want to include it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Template&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pastebin.com/zvjFKZAb&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;access the enhanced version of the template here&lt;/a&gt;. It includes more Leitner boxes and the more complicated schedule. To use it, simply paste it into a new page in Roam Research, e.g. &amp;ldquo;Spaced Repetition&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;spaced-repetition-alternatives&#34;&gt;Spaced Repetition Alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are multiple ways of doing spaced repetition in Roam, of which this is just one. Note that most spaced repetition systems in Roam Research use the &amp;ldquo;delta&amp;rdquo; feature. However, we are not using this feature. CortexFutura provides 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cortexfutura.com/preliminary-spaced-repetition-roam/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;a way of using the delta feature for spaced repetition here&lt;/a&gt;. Roam Toolkit provides another system for doing spaced repetition in Roam, which you can 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08o8q_bOedw&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;view on YouTube here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most popular spaced repetition systems is called 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.ankiweb.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Anki&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s great for language learning. I&amp;rsquo;d be remiss not to mention it. The reason I prefer doing spaced repetition directly in Roam is that the friction to creating cards is much lower in Roam for me, since I&amp;rsquo;m taking notes and writing my ideas in there already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally RemNote, a competitor note-taking tool to Roam, also offers a highly configurable spaced repetition system out-of-the-box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more, consider joining the conversation in the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://roamresearch.slack.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Roam Research Slack&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;spaced-repetition&amp;rdquo; channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;two-advantages-of-this-system-over-traditional-spaced-repetition-systems&#34;&gt;Two advantages of this system over traditional spaced repetition systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower friction:&lt;/strong&gt; Creating cards directly in your note-taking app is substantially easier than needing to task switch to create cards. This lower mental overhead makes it easier to keep using spaced repetition for an extended period of time. I started using it two months ago myself, so finger&amp;rsquo;s crossed it indeed is something I keep up for much longer! 🤞&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robustness to vacations:&lt;/strong&gt; In traditional spaced repetition systems, taking a break for a day, week, or month, can be ruinous to your spaced repetition rhythm. After coming back from the break, you find you have too many cards to review all at once, which can be a real motivation drain. Instead of organizing cards by &lt;strong&gt;date&lt;/strong&gt;, my system organizes them by &lt;strong&gt;review session number.&lt;/strong&gt; This means that if you skip a day or a week, your reviews simply get pushed back. The review session number won&amp;rsquo;t go up while you&amp;rsquo;re away. You can even split a review session over multiple days if you like. No trouble! You&amp;rsquo;ll never be left with a review session that&amp;rsquo;s too big to handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Programmatically Accessing Chrome&#39;s “Tabs from other devices” Data</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-01-programmatically-accessing-chromes-tabs-from-other-devices-data/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-01-programmatically-accessing-chromes-tabs-from-other-devices-data/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I use Google Chrome on my Mac laptop and on my iPhone, and I&amp;rsquo;m logged in to my Google account in both places with syncing turned on. If I go to &amp;ldquo;chrome://history/syncedTabs&amp;rdquo; on my computer I can see what tabs I have open on my phone. Now, I&amp;rsquo;d like to access this data programatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the help of &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve figured out that this data is stored in &lt;code&gt;~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Profile 1/Sync Data/LevelDB/&lt;/code&gt; (Probably for most people the path would be &lt;code&gt;~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Sync Data/LevelDB/&lt;/code&gt;). Be careful to escape the spaces in the file path!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To read from a LevelDB database, I first installed leveldb with &lt;code&gt;brew install leveldb&lt;/code&gt;, and then I installed a Python LevelDB client: &lt;code&gt;pip install plyvel&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then use little Python scripts like the following to access the data, though I haven&amp;rsquo;t quite figured out (1) how to properly parse the data; it&amp;rsquo;s probably a protocol buffer, or (2) exactly how it&amp;rsquo;s organized, so I don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly which keys to look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I have copied the LevelDB folder to a new location before opening it. This ensures that Chrome doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a lock on any of the files in the copy, and that even if we make a mistake we won&amp;rsquo;t damage Chrome&amp;rsquo;s data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;import plyvel
import re
import os

db = plyvel.DB(os.path.expanduser(&amp;quot;~/Profile1/Sync Data/LevelDB/&amp;quot;))

for key, value in db.iterator():
  if b&#39;sessions-dt&#39; in key:
    data = re.findall(b&#39;https?://[\x20-\x7F]+&#39;, value)
    if data:
      print(key)
      print(data)
      print()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This script prints out the URLs of the synced tabs, plus some extra data and extra characters. To do this properly, the next step will be to figure out how to parse the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do I want to programmatically figure out which tabs are open on my phone? I want to do automatic distraction detection. When I&amp;rsquo;m on a distracting website like Twitter for several minutes during a period when I mean to be focusing on something else, I&amp;rsquo;d like Bieber Bot to be able to stage an intervention to help me focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variation on the script above should be sufficient for figuring out if I have any distracting websites open on my phone. So, I may be able to implement the distraction detection and intervention logic even before getting the parsing done correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Where do thoughts come from? A thought experiment.</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-29-where-do-thoughts-come-from-a-thought-experiment/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-29-where-do-thoughts-come-from-a-thought-experiment/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This snippet details a thought experiment I&amp;rsquo;ve been encouraging people to do for years. It&amp;rsquo;s simple, and should only take a few minutes of your time. The purpose of the thought experiment is to better understand where your thoughts come from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are just four steps in the experiment: (1) think thoughts, (2) remember those thoughts and write them down, (3) determine their causes, (4) categorize those causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me explain in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) To start the experiment, &lt;strong&gt;think thoughts&lt;/strong&gt; for one minute. You can set a timer. During this minute, it&amp;rsquo;s okay for your mind to wander. It isn&amp;rsquo;t important what you think about. During this time you&amp;rsquo;re just thinking, not writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) Once the minute is over, try to &lt;strong&gt;remember all the thoughts&lt;/strong&gt; you had during that minute; &lt;strong&gt;write them all down&lt;/strong&gt; in a list. As much as possible, put that list in chronological order. It may take much more than a minute to remember and write down all those thoughts. This step can be difficult; try to be as thorough as possible. You may surprise yourself by at first not remembering thinking something, and then only after thinking hard trying to remember it finding it becoming clear as your recollection improves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) &lt;strong&gt;Determine the causes&lt;/strong&gt; of the thoughts. For each thought on the list, try to determine &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; that thought arose. What was the cause of that thought arising in your mind? For some thoughts the cause will be obvious. For others it may not be obvious at all; don&amp;rsquo;t give up. Really spend some time trying to determine why you thought all the things you thought. I believe there is always a reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(4) Finally, look over the complete list of reasons. &lt;strong&gt;Come up with categories&lt;/strong&gt; for the reasons. Maybe one thought arose because something you saw or smelled triggered a memory. Maybe other thoughts arose because one word sounds like another. Be creative in how you categorize thoughts. There&amp;rsquo;s no right or wrong way to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s all. This whole experiment can take less than half an hour, less or more depending on how into it you get and how detailed you are. While it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take that much time, it can be mentally draining. Have some water, relax, treat yourself when you&amp;rsquo;re done :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, the purpose of the experiment is to better understand where thoughts come from. Individually, this experiment helps us better understand ourselves through introspection. Through sharing the results with each other, it can also help us better understand each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would be absolutely delighted to hear from you if you do this experiment. You can reach me at 
&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:david810&amp;#43;thinking@gmail.com&#34;&gt;david810+thinking@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;. Feel free to send me your thoughts, causes, and categories from the experiment (or just a subset if any of that is too personal to share). And I would of course also love to hear your thoughts about the experiment too, or your thoughts on thinking. Really, don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Publishing Blog Posts from Roam Research Quickly and Automatically</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-28-publishing-blog-posts-from-roam-research-quickly-and-automatically/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-28-publishing-blog-posts-from-roam-research-quickly-and-automatically/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought today I would attempt a proper treatment of my latest automatic &amp;ldquo;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/&#34;&gt;snippet&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; publishing system. It uses JavaScript embedded directly in Roam Research to publish snippets to my website with low latency as I write them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prior-methods&#34;&gt;Prior methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously I&amp;rsquo;ve written a system to allow 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-09-27-posting-snippets-from-my-phone/&#34;&gt;Bieber Bot to publish snippets that I send him&lt;/a&gt;, and followed that up with a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-06-introducing-the-snippet-queue/&#34;&gt;snippet queue&lt;/a&gt; to allow me to schedule the publication of my snippets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve then also implemented two previous automatic snippet publishers from Roam. The first used my roam-to-git backup to detect new or updated snippets. The second used a puppeteer instance to occasionally check Roam for new or updated snippets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That makes this my third implementation of automatic snippet publishing from Roam, and my fifth automatic snippet publishing project to date. It&amp;rsquo;s the fastest yet, going from Roam to live on the website in just 90 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;room-for-improvement&#34;&gt;Room for improvement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why was publishing through Bieber Bot not enough? Roam is a natural place to write, and I find I write quite a bit more here than I do elsewhere. Since snippets are 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2019-12-30-writing-for-no-audience/&#34;&gt;all about lowering the barrier of entry to writing&lt;/a&gt;, supporting writing snippets in Roam seems natural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why was the roam-to-git backup based automatic publication system insufficient? While, adequate, the latency between writing a snippet and having it show up on my website was multiple hours. The roam-to-git backups only trigger every hour, and fail about 30% of the time. The script to use those backups to publish to my website would also only run every hour. Their combined schedules meant it could be 2-3 or more hours between writing a snippet and being able to share the link to it. Lowering this latency would give me more freedom to quickly write and share snippets, and also to iterate on a published snippet. Fast iteration is powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, why was the puppeteer-based approach insufficient. While this approach had the potential to bring the publication latency down considerably, in practice I scheduled in to run about hourly, since a headless browser is a computationally heavy piece of software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-new-approach-roamjs&#34;&gt;The new approach: &amp;ldquo;roam/js&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roam Research allows you to write JavaScript to run directly in Roam. My new approach is to run JavaScript in Roam to detect when a new snippet is written or when an existing snippet gets updated. When this occurs, the script will trigger a GitHub Action, using the snippet content and metadata as input. The GitHub Action will commit the snippet to my website&amp;rsquo;s git repo, and trigger a rebuilding of my website. It does everything except the final deploy to the webserver automatically; that final step waits for me to send a message &amp;ldquo;Deploy snippets!&amp;rdquo; to Bieber Bot, upon receipt of which the final deploy step is performed and the website is updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this approach it takes only 90 seconds between writing or editing a snippet and having it live on my website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;detecting-new-snippets-and-snippet-updates&#34;&gt;Detecting new snippets and snippet updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two key pieces to how I detect new and updated snippets. The first is a &amp;ldquo;mutation observer&amp;rdquo;. A mutation observer is an object in JavaScript that allows you to schedule events to occur when DOM changes are made to a website. In Roam, the DOM is modified when the user makes edits, and so DOM changes can indicate that the user has made a change to their notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to detect when a snippet is created or edited. So, we write a function that detects if a snippet has been created or edited since the last time it was called, and we use a mutation observer to call this function when the DOM changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since DOM changes can occur very frequently in Roam, we use a technique called 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidwalsh.name/javascript-debounce-function&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;debouncing&lt;/a&gt; to limit the number of calls to this detection function during periods of many consecutive DOM changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we detect if a snippet has been created or edited? Roam Research provides a datalog API that allows us to query our entire Roam graph using a logic programming language. You can 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-22-datalog-queries-for-roam-research/&#34;&gt;learn more about how this works here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mark a snippet for publication by tagging it with both the &amp;ldquo;Snippets&amp;rdquo; tag, and the &amp;ldquo;ok-to-publish&amp;rdquo; tag. This query detects those blocks that are part of a publishable snippet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;ancestor = `[ 
 [(ancestor ?child ?parent) 
  [?parent :block/children ?child]] 
 [(ancestor ?child ?ancestor) 
  [?parent :block/children ?child] 
  (ancestor ?parent ?ancestor)]]
]`;

block_info = window.roamAlphaAPI.q(`[
  :find ?uid ?child_text ?child_uid ?parent_uid ?order
  :in $ %
  :where
  [?block :block/uid ?uid]
  [?block :block/string ?string]
  [?block :block/refs ?snippets]
  [?block :block/refs ?publish]
  [?snippets :node/title &amp;quot;Snippets&amp;quot;]
  [?publish :node/title &amp;quot;ok-to-publish&amp;quot;]
  (ancestor ?child ?block)
  [?parent :block/children ?child]
  [?parent :block/uid ?parent_uid]
  [?child :block/uid ?child_uid]
  [?child :block/order ?order]
  [?child :block/string ?child_text]
]`, ancestor);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s break down what&amp;rsquo;s happening in this query. First, there&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;code&gt;ancestor&lt;/code&gt; rule. The Roam datalog schema only includes a blocks immediate children; the &lt;code&gt;ancestor&lt;/code&gt; rule allows us to query for all a block&amp;rsquo;s descendants or ancestors, not just the immediate ones. It does this through the recursive definition of &amp;ldquo;ancestor&amp;rdquo; shown, which you can read as &amp;ldquo;An ancestor of ?child is ?parent if ?parent has a child ?child, AND ALSO an ancestor of ?child is ?ancestor if there exists some ?parent satisfying both ?parent has a child ?child, and ?parent has ?ancestor as an ancestor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the query (lines 10-24) finds blocks that are the descendants of a block ?block that&amp;rsquo;s tagged with both &amp;ldquo;Snippets&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;ok-to-publish.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Datalog returns the results in an arbitrary order, we need to use the :block/order attribute to reconstruct the proper order of the blocks that comprise the snippet. The logic for this isn&amp;rsquo;t shown, but don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to reach out if this interests you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, our mutation observer keeps track of the text of each of the snippets, and if any of them change or if a new snippet is introduced, it triggers a GitHub Action to deploy the snippet to my website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;writing-a-github-action-to-update-my-website&#34;&gt;Writing a GitHub Action to update my website&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My website uses a static site generator, Hugo. So, updating my website consists of adding a markdown file to 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dbieber/davidbieber.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;its GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;, rebuilding the site by running Hugo, and then pushing the generated static files up to my server. All of these steps can be automated in a GitHub action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;triggering-a-github-action-from-roam-research&#34;&gt;Triggering a GitHub Action from Roam Research&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To trigger a GitHub Action from Roam Research, I set up the action to trigger on &amp;ldquo;repository_dispatch&amp;rdquo; events. I created a personal authentication token, and then use the following JavaScript to trigger the GitHub Action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;function publishSnippetRaw(uid, title, date, content) {
  const data = {
    &amp;quot;event_type&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;snippet-update&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;client_payload&amp;quot;: {
      &amp;quot;uid&amp;quot;: uid,
      &amp;quot;title&amp;quot;: title,
      &amp;quot;date&amp;quot;: date,
      &amp;quot;content&amp;quot;: content,
    }
  };
  fetch(
    &amp;quot;https://api.github.com/repos/dbieber/davidbieber.com/dispatches&amp;quot;,
    {
      headers: {
        Accept: &amp;quot;application/vnd.github.everest-preview+json&amp;quot;,
        Authorization: &amp;quot;token PERSONAL_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN&amp;quot;,
      },
      method: &#39;POST&#39;,
      body: JSON.stringify(data),
    }
  );
}
const publishSnippet = debounce(publishSnippetRaw, 15000, true);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This call to &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt; starts the GitHub Action running on a GitHub server within seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;accepting-inputs-in-a-github-action&#34;&gt;Accepting inputs in a GitHub Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will notice that &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; contains a &amp;ldquo;client_payload&amp;rdquo; in the above JavaScript. To accept inputs in the GitHub Action, I access the data from the client_payload and set it to an environment variable in the Action YAML like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34;&gt;env:
  SNIPPET_UID: ${{ github.event.client_payload.uid }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environment variables like this can then be used by the steps in the action. This allows me to pass the contents of the new/modified snippet to the GitHub Action, which is everything needed for automating its publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GitHub Action writes the markdown file, commits it to the repository, runs hugo to regenerate the static files for the website, and commits those to the appropriate part of the repo as well. The only step remaining at this point is pushing the new files up to my server to serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;deploying-with-ansible&#34;&gt;Deploying with Ansible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ansible.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ansible&lt;/a&gt; to deploy my website to its lone server. 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/bieber-bot/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Bieber Bot&lt;/a&gt; is also quite capable of using Ansible. So, we have an arrangement where I tell Bieber Bot when to redeploy my website, and he does so for me. This way I can deploy my website even when I&amp;rsquo;m on the go and not at a computer; I just message him using my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All steps, from the last keystroke of writing a snippet to having it show up live on my website, together take about 90 seconds. This is a significant quality-of-life improvement over the multi-hour latency of just a few days ago. I&amp;rsquo;m hopeful that the result is I&amp;rsquo;ll write even more.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Even Faster Snippet Publishing from Roam</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-27-even-faster-snippet-publishing-from-roam/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 27 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-27-even-faster-snippet-publishing-from-roam/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve set up a GitHub action to enable even faster automatic publishing of snippets from Roam. This is a test-snippet I&amp;rsquo;m using while writing the auto-publisher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see how it behaves if I&amp;rsquo;m editing an existing snippet routinely for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it works as intended, the snippet will update itself on GitHub after I stop typing for several seconds. I&amp;rsquo;ve now stopped typing, we&amp;rsquo;ll see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It worked! 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dbieber/davidbieber.com/commit/1f1ad4680e1d538f699cf2cd420f0c04a4bf528a&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the commit&lt;/a&gt; that was made automatically after I finished the previous sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will make publishing snippets &lt;strong&gt;even easier&lt;/strong&gt; going forward. It also means I don&amp;rsquo;t need to keep a puppeteer instance constantly live with Roam open like I&amp;rsquo;d originally planned for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total latency from writing to publication is now just 90 seconds. So you could be reading this mere minutes after I write it!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Python&#39;s strip, lstrip, and rstrip in JavaScript</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-26-pythons-strip-lstrip-and-rstrip-in-javascript/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-26-pythons-strip-lstrip-and-rstrip-in-javascript/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Python provides some convenient functions for manipulating strings: &lt;code&gt;strip&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;lstrip&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;rstrip&lt;/code&gt;. Recently I was writing some JavaScript and wanted to use &lt;code&gt;rstrip&lt;/code&gt;. So, I&amp;rsquo;ve implemented all three. Here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-python-strip-method-in-javascript&#34;&gt;The Python strip method in JavaScript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Python, &lt;code&gt;strip&lt;/code&gt; removes whitespace from the beginning or end of a string. This is commonly called &amp;ldquo;trim&amp;rdquo; in JavaScript, and is provided as a builtin in most modern browsers. You may need to implement it yourself if you want to support older browsers though. Here&amp;rsquo;s one possible implementation, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_strip.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;courtesy of W3Schools&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;function trim(x) {
  return x.replace(/^\s+|\s+$/gm, &#39;&#39;);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Python &lt;code&gt;strip&lt;/code&gt; method optionally accepts an argument, &amp;ldquo;characters&amp;rdquo;, and strips all instances of those characters from the left and right sides of the input string. We implement that here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;function trim(x, characters) {
  var start = 0;
  while (characters.indexOf(x[start]) &amp;gt;= 0) {
    start += 1;
  }
  var end = x.length - 1;
  while (characters.indexOf(x[end]) &amp;gt;= 0) {
    end -= 1;
  }
  return x.substr(start, end - start + 1);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may not be the most efficient implementation (the calls to indexOf in particular could be made faster), but it gets the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-python-rstrip-method-in-javascript&#34;&gt;The Python rstrip method in JavaScript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rstrip method behaves like strip, but only removes spaces (or the specified characters) from the right side of the input string. We implement this in JavaScript now, calling it &amp;ldquo;rtrim&amp;rdquo; for consistency with the name &amp;ldquo;trim&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;function rtrim(x) {
  // This implementation removes whitespace from the right side
  // of the input string.
  return x.replace(/\s+$/gm, &#39;&#39;);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now implement rtrim a second time, now accepting &amp;ldquo;characters&amp;rdquo; as input:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;function rtrim(x, characters) {
  var start = 0;
  var end = x.length - 1;
  while (characters.indexOf(x[end]) &amp;gt;= 0) {
    end -= 1;
  }
  return x.substr(0, end + 1);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-python-lstrip-method-in-javascript&#34;&gt;The Python lstrip method in JavaScript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally we provide a port of Python&amp;rsquo;s lstrip to JavaScript, calling it ltrim. We again provide one version that strips only whitespace, and a second that strips the provided &amp;ldquo;characters&amp;rdquo; input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;function ltrim(x) {
  // This implementation removes whitespace from the left side
  // of the input string.
  return x.replace(/^\s+/gm, &#39;&#39;);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now implement ltrim a second time, now accepting &amp;ldquo;characters&amp;rdquo; as input:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;function ltrim(x, characters) {
  var start = 0;
  while (characters.indexOf(x[start]) &amp;gt;= 0) {
    start += 1;
  }
  var end = x.length - 1;
  return x.substr(start);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;example-usage&#34;&gt;Example Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some example usages of the above functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, using the implementations that strip spaces:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;trim(&#39;   Hello world!   &#39;) === &#39;Hello world!&#39;;
ltrim(&#39;   Hello world!   &#39;) === &#39;Hello world!   &#39;;
rtrim(&#39;   Hello world!   &#39;) === &#39;   Hello world!&#39;;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, using the implementations that strip the specified characters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;trim(&#39;Buzzzzzz&#39;, &#39;Bz&#39;) === &#39;u&#39;;
ltrim(&#39;Buzzzzzz&#39;, &#39;Bz&#39;) === &#39;uzzzzzz&#39;;
rtrim(&#39;Buzzzzzz&#39;, &#39;Bz&#39;) === &#39;Bu&#39;;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>Improving Roam Snippet Publishing Speeds</title>

      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-23-improving-roam-snippet-publishing-speeds/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey folks, I have a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/bieber-bot/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;workflow&lt;/a&gt; for automatically publishing &amp;ldquo;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2019-12-30-writing-for-no-audience/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;snippets&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; to my website from Roam. Currently there&amp;rsquo;s a multi-hour latency between writing a snippet and when it appears on my website. In this snippet I&amp;rsquo;m going to muse about / ask questions about how to use &lt;strong&gt;puppeteer&lt;/strong&gt; to bring this latency down considerably. This&amp;rsquo;ll be my first time using puppeteer, so help appreciated. Read on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/10.2/apple-small/1f62e@2x.png&#34; alt=&#34;😮&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current system relies on my git-to-roam backup, which runs every hour and fails some fraction of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to bring the latency down, the idea is to use pyppeteer (the python puppeteer bindings) to log into Roam in a headless browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will monitor Roam for new (or modified) snippets, and will publish them to my website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A snippet is OK to publish if its tagged with both &amp;ldquo;Snippets&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;ok-to-publish&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, first question: has anyone done this before? B/c if someone&amp;rsquo;s already gotten all the CSS/XPATH selectors for logging in, navigating, etc, that could save me some time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important thing I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about: are there problems keeping an instance of Roam open in a headless browser could cause?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E.g. I hear about occasional data loss which seems related to having out-of-date instances of Roam open on other machines &amp;ndash; e.g. maybe the out of date Roam comes back online and overwrites new content with older blank content?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;rsquo;ll make my headless Roam instances relatively-short lived (&amp;lt;10 minutes) just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the strategy I&amp;rsquo;ll take will be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log in to Roam in headless browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run datalog query in javascript to check for new/updated snippets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run that query fairly frequently (e.g. every few seconds) in order to detect snippets as soon as they&amp;rsquo;re available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debounce, so that if a snippet is actively changing its only deployed ~twice, not 100 times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then every 10 minutes or so I&amp;rsquo;ll have it take a short breather and refresh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abhay suggested using the alpha API for this rather than puppeteering. &lt;img src=&#34;https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/10.2/apple-medium/1f64f@2x.png&#34; alt=&#34;🙏&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;rsquo;ll get started on the puppeteer implementation now though anyway, even if the API ends up being a better way of doing this in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a first draft that handles log in and running the query to detect publishable material (blocks with the appropriate two tags).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure how reliable login is as I had some hiccups getting it working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the headless browser seems very slow to notice changes to the Roam graph compared to what I&amp;rsquo;m used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead of checking every few seconds, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll just check once a minute or so, refreshing either every time or every few times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unexpected snag: I get the children of a block but I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to put them in the proper order!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(with datalog)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could navigate to the block and look at the dom&amp;hellip; but hopefully I don&amp;rsquo;t need to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks like there is an &amp;ldquo;order&amp;rdquo; attribute, so this will be doable. Might be messy though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;rsquo;m understanding right, :block/order gives the index of a block into its parents children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re good! &lt;img src=&#34;https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/10.2/apple-medium/1f44d@2x.png&#34; alt=&#34;👍&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this on my website, it worked!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Datalog Queries for Roam Research</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-22-datalog-queries-for-roam-research/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-22-datalog-queries-for-roam-research/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://roamresearch.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Roam Research&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent note taking tool. One of its core features is &amp;ldquo;back links&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; any of your notes can easily references any of your other notes, and so all your notes end up linked together in an intricate graph structure. You can quickly see all the references to a note, hence the term &amp;ldquo;back link&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roam exposes all of the information in your graph through a &lt;strong&gt;datalog API&lt;/strong&gt;. Datalog is a declarative programming language that lets you make queries about your graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn datalog, I recommend &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.learndatalogtoday.org/&#34;&gt;http://www.learndatalogtoday.org/&lt;/a&gt;. It teaches how to write datalog queries in 8 relatively short chapters chock full of examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to see how to use datalog specifically for Roam, you can head over to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.putyourleftfoot.in/introduction-to-the-roam-alpha-api&#34;&gt;https://www.putyourleftfoot.in/introduction-to-the-roam-alpha-api&lt;/a&gt;. Or keep reading!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;examples&#34;&gt;Examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this snippet I include a number of examples of useful datalog queries for Roam Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-run-a-query&#34;&gt;How to Run a Query&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open the JavaScript console. Paste the query. Hit enter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To open the JavaScript console in Chrome, hit cmd-option-J on Mac or Ctrl-shift-J on Windows. For other systems, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=how%20to%20open%20the%20javascript%20console&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;you can look up how to open it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pages-modified-today&#34;&gt;Pages modified today&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This query returns a list of pages that have been modified today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;let ancestorrule=`[ 
   [ (ancestor ?b ?a) 
        [?a :block/children ?b] ] 
   [ (ancestor ?b ?a) 
        [?parent :block/children ?b ] 
        (ancestor ?parent ?a) ] ] ]`;

let references = window.roamAlphaAPI.q(`[
  :find ?title
  :in $ ?start_of_day %
  :where
  [?page :node/title ?title]
  (ancestor ?block ?page)
  [?block :edit/time ?time]
  [(&amp;gt; ?time ?start_of_day)]
]`, new Date().setHours(0, 0, 0, 0), ancestorrule);

references.map(
  (data, index) =&amp;gt; {return `${data[0]}`;})
.join(&#39;\n&#39;);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run it in the javascript console, it should print out a list of pages that have been modified today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;references-to-a-specific-page&#34;&gt;References to a specific page&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This query finds all blocks referencing a specific page. Replace &amp;ldquo;Roam Research&amp;rdquo; in the query with the name of the page that you want to find the references of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;let references = window.roamAlphaAPI.q(`[
  :find ?text
  :in $ ?title
  :where
  [?page :node/title ?title]
  [?e :block/refs ?page]
  [?e :block/string ?text]
]`, &#39;Roam Research&#39;);

references.map((data, index) =&amp;gt; {return data[0];}).join(&#39;\n&#39;);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;all-blocks-on-a-specific-page&#34;&gt;All blocks on a specific page&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This query finds all blocks on a specific page. Again replace &amp;ldquo;Roam Research&amp;rdquo; with the name of the page you&amp;rsquo;re interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;let ancestorrule=`[ 
   [ (ancestor ?b ?a) 
        [?a :block/children ?b] ] 
   [ (ancestor ?b ?a) 
        [?parent :block/children ?b ] 
        (ancestor ?parent ?a) ] ] ]`;
let blocks = window.roamAlphaAPI.q(`[ 
  :find 
      ?string
  :in $ ?pagetitle % 
  :where 
      [?block :block/string ?string] 
      [?page :node/title ?pagetitle] 
      (ancestor ?block ?page)
  ]`, &amp;quot;Roam Research&amp;quot;, ancestorrule);

blocks.map((data, index) =&amp;gt; {return data[0];}).join(&#39;\n&#39;);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;all-blocks-with-at-least-100-descendants&#34;&gt;All blocks with at least 100 descendants&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This script finds all blocks with at least 100 descendants. The idea is that these blocks may have notes that are worth revisiting, either to summarize or reflect on. The threshold &amp;ldquo;100&amp;rdquo; is of course configurable at the top of the script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;let threshold = 100;
let ancestorrule=`[ 
   [ (ancestor ?child ?parent) 
        [?parent :block/children ?child] ]
   [ (ancestor ?child ?a) 
        [?parent :block/children ?child ] 
        (ancestor ?parent ?a) ] ] ]`;

let large_blocks = window.roamAlphaAPI.q(`
[:find ?ancestor (count ?block)
  :in $ % 
  :where 
    [?ancestor :block/string]
    [?block :block/string]
    (ancestor ?block ?ancestor)]
`, ancestorrule).filter((data, index) =&amp;gt; {return data[1] &amp;gt;= threshold});

let results = window.roamAlphaAPI.q(`[
  :find ?text ?uid ?childcount
  :in $ ?block ?childcount
  :where
  [?block :block/string ?text]
  [?block :block/uid ?uid]
]`, large_blocks)
  
results.map((data, index) =&amp;gt; {return `((${data[1]})) (${data[2]})`}).join(&#39;\n&#39;);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;support-and-debugging&#34;&gt;Support and Debugging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;#querying&amp;rdquo; channel on the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://roamresearch.slack.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Roam Research Slack&lt;/a&gt; is active and the community there is quite friendly. If you&amp;rsquo;re crafting or debugging a query, that&amp;rsquo;s a great place to ask for help or share your progress.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Looking back on my browsing history snippets</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-20-looking-back-on-my-browsing-history-snippets/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 20 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-20-looking-back-on-my-browsing-history-snippets/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve now written several snippets about my analyzing my browsing history programmatically. I figured I&amp;rsquo;d collect them all in one place here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2019-12-30-analyzing-my-browser-history/&#34;&gt;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2019-12-30-analyzing-my-browser-history/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-03-19-browsing-history/&#34;&gt;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-03-19-browsing-history/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-11-browser-history-queries/&#34;&gt;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-11-browser-history-queries/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-12-simplifying-sql-with-with/&#34;&gt;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-12-simplifying-sql-with-with/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-20-browser-history-date-queries/&#34;&gt;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-20-browser-history-date-queries/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-26-daily-browser-history-summaries/&#34;&gt;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-26-daily-browser-history-summaries/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-30-detecting-sleeping-hours/&#34;&gt;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-30-detecting-sleeping-hours/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-05-15-roaming-the-web/&#34;&gt;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-05-15-roaming-the-web/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presumably as I write more about this, the list will go out of date. And that&amp;rsquo;s alright. This is just a snippet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This motivates me to move all my snippets into Roam Research. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to do this just yet, but it seems a decent idea. Backlinks/tags would then allow for easily keeping an up-to-date list of all the snippets I&amp;rsquo;ve written about various topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back on these many browsing history snippets, what themes stand out? Browser histories are rich with information about our lives. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot we can do to make our lives better using that information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can detect if we&amp;rsquo;re getting distracted, and have automated interventions if we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can figure out our interests, and notice if they&amp;rsquo;re drifting over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can reflect on things we&amp;rsquo;ve learned or thought about in the past, revisiting our old ideas. This can help generate new ideas, and also strengthen our memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve made some progress on automated distraction detection. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to write a snippet about that soon. I&amp;rsquo;ve also recently poked at getting my browsing history from my phone on my computer, so that can be analyzed in near real-time too. This promises to make distraction detection even more compelling. Very excited to teach Bieber Bot how to stage a distraction intervention some time in the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Derivative of Softmax and the Softmax Cross Entropy Loss</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-12-derivative-of-softmax-and-the-softmax-cross-entropy-loss/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 12 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-12-derivative-of-softmax-and-the-softmax-cross-entropy-loss/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Write $y_i = \text{softmax}(\textbf{x})_i = \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum e^{x_d}}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, $\textbf{y}$ is the softmax of $\textbf{x}$. Softmax computes a normalized exponential of its input vector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next write $L = -\sum t_i \ln(y_i)$. This is the softmax cross entropy loss. $t_i$ is a 0/1 target representing whether the correct class is class $i$. We will compute the derivative of $L$ with respect to the inputs to the softmax function $\textbf{x}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have $\frac{dL}{dx_j} = -\sum t_i \frac{1}{y_i} \frac{dy_i}{d{x_j}}$ from the chain rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We compute $\frac{dy_i}{dx_j}$ using the quotient rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If $i = j$, this gives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$\frac{dy_i}{dx_j} = \frac{\sum e^{x_d} \cdot e^{x_i} - e^{x_i} \cdot e^{x_i}}{(\sum e^{x_d})^2}$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$\frac{dy_i}{dx_j} = \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum e^{x_d}} \cdot \left(\frac{\sum e^{x_d} - e^{x_i}}{\sum e^{x_d}}\right)$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$\frac{dy_i}{dx_j} = y_i \cdot (1 - y_i)$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If $i \ne j$, this gives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$\frac{dy_i}{dx_j} = \frac{\sum e^{x_d} \cdot 0 - e^{x_i} \cdot e^{x_j}}{(\sum e^{x_d})^2}$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$\frac{dy_i}{dx_j} = -\frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum e^{x_d}} \cdot \frac{e^{x_j}}{\sum e^{x_d}} $&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$\frac{dy_i}{dx_j} = -y_i y_j$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together these equations give us the derivative of the softmax function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$\frac{dy_i}{dx_j} = \begin{cases} y_i \cdot (1 - y_i) &amp;amp; i=j \\\ -y_i y_j &amp;amp; i \ne j \end{cases}$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this result, we can finish computing the derivative of $L$. This gives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$\frac{dL}{dx_j} = -\sum t_i \frac{1}{y_i} \frac{dy_i}{d{x_j}} = \sum\limits_i \begin{cases} t_i (y_i - 1) &amp;amp; i=j \\\ t_i y_j &amp;amp; i \ne j \end{cases}$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since exactly one of the $t_i$s is 1 and the rest are zeros this further simplifies to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$\frac{dL}{dx_j} = y_j - t_j$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have computed the derivative of the softmax cross-entropy loss $L$ with respect to the inputs to the softmax function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This page is an experiment in publishing directly from Roam Research. &lt;del&gt;It is incomplete, and the formatting is probably all wonky. Bear with me while I get this sorted.&lt;/del&gt; Update (December 13th, 2020): The formatting looks good now!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Brainstorming “Mandatory Reading” for Dodam</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-06-brainstorming-mandatory-reading-for-dodam/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 06 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-06-brainstorming-mandatory-reading-for-dodam/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dodam asked me what ideas I thought were most essential. Here are my first thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;idea-programming-literacy&#34;&gt;Idea: Programming literacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Material: COS 126 (for example)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the ways in which ideas can be combined is essential for creativity and problem solving. Not being able to see how software can make things possible is a significant setback for this. (Has positives too: constraints beget creativity. This constraint isn’t worth it though!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of people I interact with have this skillset. So it can be momentarily jarring when it&amp;rsquo;s absent (if it becomes relevant).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;idea-understanding-other-peoples-limitations&#34;&gt;Idea: Understanding other people’s limitations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Material: &lt;a href=&#34;https://xkcd.com/1053/&#34;&gt;https://xkcd.com/1053/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/ten_thousand.png&#34; alt=&#34;Ten Thousand&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding out that someone doesn&amp;rsquo;t know something you expect them to know can be jarring, but being condescending or judgemental in response doesn&amp;rsquo;t help anyone. It&amp;rsquo;s okay to let the person know you&amp;rsquo;re surprised by their lack of knowledge, but best to refrain from adding any negative valence to this surprisal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are essentially no benefits to disrespecting or being incredulous about someone’s limitations in knowledge/skill/memory/etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone learns faster, and everyone finds the world more interesting when these limitations are acknowledged in a supportive way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus it’s respectful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People‘s experiences are varied. Our memories are limited. Our values are different. Let’s help each other to learn and remember, even the most “obvious” of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;idea-super-communication&#34;&gt;Idea: Super-communication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Material: Khan Academy blog post from Ben Kamens &lt;a href=&#34;https://bjk5.com/post/71887196490/email-transparency-at-khan-academy#_=_&#34;&gt;https://bjk5.com/post/71887196490/email-transparency-at-khan-academy#_=_&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people at Khan Academy are incredibly productive (c. 2013). Collectively this group is super talented, driven, and least expectedly: super-communicative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog post linked above gives a small taste of how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main takeaway from that summer is the value of “super communication”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make every thought, action, idea public to the people it might affect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear: They don’t need a notification about every thought; they might never read 90% of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has a number of positive effects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confidence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you’re thinking of performing some action, e.g. moving a stack of bricks to where they’ll be used. You think it’s the right thing to do, but you’re not 100% sure. Do you ask someone? Do you do it anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under super-communication you don’t ask permission, you instead announce your intent to move the bricks. Then wait a moment before starting to move them to give people a chance to see your message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since all stakeholders have access to this announcement, you can start doing the things you think is right: moving the bricks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone would let you know if they think you shouldn’t be doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So through super communication you can take more ownership over construction without worrying about stepping on people’s toes or messing up bigger plans. (To clarify, this strategy requires the broadcasted message to have &lt;strong&gt;some&lt;/strong&gt; visibility, e.g. a low-priority chat room; this doesn&amp;rsquo;t work if no one is going to see the message.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thinking things through&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super communication is hard work. It’s time consuming to share every thought. But a benefit of this is it makes you concretize your thoughts. Sharing them forces you to put them into words that others can understand. In doing so you naturally think through what others would think of your idea, and so your idea develops and improves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also make yourself open to receiving feedback and thoughts on your idea, which can improve the idea and lead to new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trust and transparency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting your ideas out in the open gives people a better sense of where you&amp;rsquo;re coming from, and what your intentions are. It builds trust, and prevents misunderstandings about who is doing what and when.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No surprises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll avoid having situations where person A thought person B was working on X is person B has actively been communicating that they&amp;rsquo;re working on Y.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super communication is hard work. I fall out of the habit quickly. But every time I’m reminded of its value and my experience at Khan Academy I’m reinforced in my belief that is worth striving for, and at least for a short time I’m better for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;idea-communication-bubblesbonding-and-bridging&#34;&gt;Idea: Communication bubbles/bonding and bridging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Material: Maybe start with &lt;a href=&#34;https://ncase.me/crowds/&#34;&gt;https://ncase.me/crowds/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: &amp;ldquo;A healthy society needs a sweet spot of bonds within groups and bridges between groups.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicky Case links to more substantive material if you want to dive deeper. The idea itself is simple though; it’s being actively conscious of it that’s important and which can be challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;idea-castles-in-the-clouds-as-belief-systems&#34;&gt;Idea: Castles in the clouds as belief systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core idea is that all beliefs have provenance, but the provenance can be lost while the beliefs remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a good source for this one, but I think it’s essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironic, eh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll elaborate more on this idea later.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>4.2e-8 of All of Human Experience</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-03-4.2e-8-of-all-of-human-experience/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-03-4.2e-8-of-all-of-human-experience/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;About 107 billion people have &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across all time, the average life expectancy of a person is just under 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there have only been 3.21 trillion person-years experienced. Total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7.8 billion people are alive today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average age globally is about 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So living people today collectively hold about 234 billion years of experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means that a little &lt;strong&gt;over 7% of all human experience is held by living people&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day spent alone constitutes 8.5e-16 of all of human experience. A month is 2.6e-14 of all of human experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year spent with a partner is 6.2e-13 of all of human experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four years spent with 1500 other students is 1.9e-9 of all of human experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By a crude estimate, a whopping 4.2e-8 of all human experience was spent watching Game of Thrones. Humanity will never get that time back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are small numbers, but not &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; small. Thinking that my graduating class alone (not even counting the people a year above or below me) holds nearly 2e-9 of all human experience from our four years together is kind of mind-bending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For comparison, let&amp;rsquo;s imagine that the surface of Earth represents all of human experience. Then 4.2e-8 of human experience (the amount dedicated to watching Game of Thrones) is represented by 8.3 square miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 6.2e-13 of human experience held by you and your partner quarantining for a year? That&amp;rsquo;s over 3400 square feet. And a whole lifetime (est. 80 years) covers 3.141 acres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are not at all negligible!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is to say: let&amp;rsquo;s treasure our existence, and let&amp;rsquo;s also not discount its significance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Supervisord</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-02-supervisord/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-02-supervisord/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Supervisord has been the single best quality-of-life improvement for software development for me in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://vikb.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Vik Bhandari&lt;/a&gt; for suggesting that I use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is supervisord? It&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;process control system,&amp;rdquo; meaning that it&amp;rsquo;s software that starts, stops, and monitors other software that you want to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an example. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have a program &lt;code&gt;check_for_sales&lt;/code&gt; that periodically pings Amazon looking for sales on that new shoe-phone you&amp;rsquo;ve had your eye on. When it notices a drop in prices, it sends you a text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without supervisord, you might start the program, and find the next day that it has hit an error (maybe one of the requests to Amazon timed out in a way you weren&amp;rsquo;t anticipating), the program terminated, and the item sold out while you weren&amp;rsquo;t looking!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With supervisord, you can have &lt;code&gt;check_for_sales&lt;/code&gt; automatically restart on failure. Supervisord will notice the failure, and restart the program for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using supervisord for all sorts of things, like monitoring Bieber Bot for new messages, keeping my website&amp;rsquo;s development server live, automatically posting snippets from Roam (like this one), and auto-processing screenshots and screen recordings that I take. I have 15 processes monitored by supervisord in total across a number of side projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before supervisord, I had half the number of processes always-on in the background on my computer. I would keep extra terminal windows open to keep them running. And restarting my computer was a pain because I had to bring up these processes one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, with supervisord, restarting my machine is no big deal. This let&amp;rsquo;s me use my computer more freely, and I feel much less hesitation in starting a new project that requires having an always-on process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can learn more about supervisord from their website 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://supervisord.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;supervisord.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Updating Google Slides through Roam Research</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-11-30-updating-google-slides-through-roam-research/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-11-30-updating-google-slides-through-roam-research/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Check out this &amp;ldquo;demo video&amp;rdquo; I made! It shows me making a presentation using Roam Research references. When I update the block in Roam that I&amp;rsquo;m referencing, the presentation gets updated automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YccjrI3fmhc&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Editing slides and docs in this way would be so useful! Being able to focus on content in Roam, and presentation in a tool that&amp;rsquo;s built for presentation (like Docs and Slides) would be such a powerful combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience, Roam is a powerful tool for &lt;strong&gt;thinking&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;note-taking&lt;/strong&gt;, but not as useful for sharing those thoughts. When you&amp;rsquo;re sharing, you want to tell a story. You want to guide the reader through your thought process, and be in control of the narrative the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Roam, the reader might wander off down some unexpected path you, the writer, weren&amp;rsquo;t anticipating. Once that happens, you&amp;rsquo;ve lost the reader. They&amp;rsquo;re going to find themselves in unpolished not-really-relevant material, and you&amp;rsquo;re not going to get to convey the narrative you were aiming for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is fine for an 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;, but not so good for telling a story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to seamlessly do your thinking in Roam while also producing polished presentations (not just Slides, but anything meant for sharing, like emails, documents, images, etc) will be an absolute game changer for how we think and communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This video may not be a real product, but it represents a real vision, and we have the technology to make it real. Now, let&amp;rsquo;s put in the work and bring this vision into reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll post more in future snippets about how I think we can build a system like this today. (And I&amp;rsquo;ll also share how I made the video, despite the product integration not having been developed yet.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Publishing Through Roam Research</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-11-24-publishing-through-roam-research/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-11-24-publishing-through-roam-research/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With this snippet I&amp;rsquo;m testing out a new snippet publishing system: publishing snippets directly from Roam Research. Using the system is simple: I simply tag any bullet with &amp;ldquo;ok-to-publish&amp;rdquo; and Bieber Bot publishes it and its children as a snippet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why another way of writing snippets? I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing quite a bit in Roam lately but I haven&amp;rsquo;t been publishing snippets lately. In truth, this new publishing mechanism is more a novelty than something practically useful. It would be easy enough to copy a snippet out of Roam into a text editor or to Bieber Bot in Facebook Messenger to publish it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It certainly is appealing to be able to publish directly in Roam where I spend a lot of my time writing though. I think being able to publish directly from Roam may appeal to many other people as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The place where it may save time is in making changes to snippets. If I write a snippet in Roam today and publish it in the usual way, any changes I make it Roam aren’t reflected in the published version. Under this new system the copy on my website can automatically be updated to match the copy in Roam whenever I make changes there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;ve marked this snippet as ok-to-publish, so once I build the system this should show up on my website. If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this there, it worked!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Letting Adriana put things in my Leitner Box</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-11-07-letting-adriana-put-things-in-my-leitner-box/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 07 Nov 2020 08:14:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-11-07-letting-adriana-put-things-in-my-leitner-box/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using spaced repetition for 2-3 weeks now. I’m not using Anki or any of the prebuilt systems that track your queue of items for you. Instead, I’m keeping the things I want to study in Roam Research and using a make-shift system of tags and Browserflow Flows to make the spaced repetition system relatively frictionless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll save the details of the system for another snippet. Today, I just want to jot down the idea of allowing Adriana (through the use of Bieber Bot) to add items to my spaced repetition system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is relatively simple, but it does involve one new component that may be tricky to implement robustly. Under this idea, Adriana would be able to send Bieber Bot a message saying e.g. “help David to learn the names of the planets” and a card would be added to my spaced repetition system saying “learn the names of the planets. -Adriana”. I could then split this card into multiple cards as I usually do when I encounter a card with too much content simultaneously, or Adriana could have Bieber Bot add smaller cards one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new component that would be necessary is giving Bieber Bot edit access to my Roam Research database. Currently he has delayed read access through Roam-to-Git, but giving him write access might mean teaching him how to use Roam in a (headless, most likely) browser. Nothing he can’t handle, but it would increase the amount of time needed to get this system up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Adriana (or any of Bieber Bot’s friends) can add cards into my spaced repetition system, this can be a fun way to learn about new topics and share new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracting Snippets from Roam Research</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-11-03-extracting-snippets-from-roam-research/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Nov 2020 15:22:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-11-03-extracting-snippets-from-roam-research/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing a lot these days inside of Roam Research. I wonder if there&amp;rsquo;s a good way to identify snippet-quality items from within my Roam database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One option would be to pick out decent-sized sections of continuous text.
If I&amp;rsquo;m taking notes in a bunch of different areas, that&amp;rsquo;s probably not well suited for publishing as a snippet unless I were to clean it up first.
But if I see there&amp;rsquo;s a large chunk of text that&amp;rsquo;s been added in a contiguous block, there&amp;rsquo;s a decent chance that its snippet-quality.
&amp;ldquo;Snippet-quality&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t a particularly high bar. The bar is really just that we&amp;rsquo;d want text that forms a coherent thought rather than being a few lines on totally unrelated thoughts (which can also appear contiguously in Roam).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I set up Roam-to-Git, so every hour my Roam database is backed up to a private GitHub repository. It would be easy enough to look through the git diffs to see if there&amp;rsquo;s something that fits this description.
One possible issue with this though is that the backup script doesn&amp;rsquo;t know if I&amp;rsquo;m in the middle of writing. So it&amp;rsquo;s possible it will catch me mid-snippet.
Perhaps if I look at the diff between head and two commits back, I can avoid missing snippets that got split over multiple commits. It&amp;rsquo;s an idea worth looking in to, though the number of false positives might be too high without a fair amount of tuning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Questions to Answer About Python Fire</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-22-questions-to-answer-about-python-fire/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Oct 2020 20:31:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-22-questions-to-answer-about-python-fire/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I&amp;rsquo;m giving a talk to Women Who Code on Python Fire. Python Fire is a Python library I wrote back in 2017 that makes command line interfaces automatically out of any Python object you give it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have my talk planned but there are a few pieces of the story I haven&amp;rsquo;t included in my talk yet. They are 1) Why did I build Python Fire? 2) How are people using Python Fire in the real world? 3) What&amp;rsquo;s it like maintaining an open source project?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the first question, I should explain how we used Boom at Nest. Boom was the proto-version of Fire that inspired Fire&amp;rsquo;s development. At Nest we had an ETL pipeline consisting of several distributed systems. For example data would pass through SQS, Kafka, Storm, and Pentaho while it was being ingested. We wanted to write tests for this complex series of systems. And we also wanted to be able to manually operate the systems. So we wrote Python functions for controlling each part of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Python&amp;rsquo;s inspect feature we then turned this collection of functions automatically into a CLI. This allowed us to reuse the same code both for writing tests and for giving the operators control over the ingestion pipelines without needing to do duplicate work. This was the inspiration for Fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To question two: there are thousands of uses of Fire on GitHub. OkCupid uses it for data analysis. One person I corresponded with uses Fire to control after market engines. About 10% of uses on GitHub are for machine learning projects, including the GPT codebase. There are also a couple hundred uses within Google too, though gflags (aka abseil) is the Google standard for CLIs still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally to question three, it&amp;rsquo;s really nice to be appreciated! I built Fire to scratch my own itch from working at Nest and Google, but after releasing Fire it&amp;rsquo;s gotten quite popular. Over 17k stars on GitHub, thousands of open source projects using it, and over ten million installs from every country around the world. It&amp;rsquo;s really nice to see my effort appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite is that someone has written a blog post explaining why Fire is a good tool for teaching Python, because it lets the beginner start programming without needing to understand any boilerplate. I&amp;rsquo;m hopeful that Fire is indeed helping people learn to program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time permitting I will add these questions and answers to my talk tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Update on my 2020 Resolution</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-09-an-update-on-my-2020-resolution/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Oct 2020 22:55:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-09-an-update-on-my-2020-resolution/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My goal for this year was to get good at communicating publicly. I decided to measure progress in terms of the number of times I communicated publicly. 100 public communications was the goal. Where am I today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my 42nd snippet for the year. I&amp;rsquo;m giving a talk on Python Fire publicly next week. I published 4 papers (
&lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12621&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;IPA-GNN&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09040&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;TF-Coder&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09067&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Unique Randomizer&lt;/a&gt;, and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14381&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;BUSTLE&lt;/a&gt;). So far two of them have been accompanied by open source releases (update: now three!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add in a handful of paper presentations and Google-internal talks, and its safe to say I&amp;rsquo;m past the half-way point toward the goal. Only trouble is we&amp;rsquo;re over 75% of the way through the year. I&amp;rsquo;d better get communicating!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Biking in the Morning</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-08-biking-in-the-morning/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Oct 2020 22:04:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-08-biking-in-the-morning/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some of the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-06-the-snippets-i-dont-publish/&#34;&gt;snippets I did not publish&lt;/a&gt; were about my plans for biking in the morning. For the last several days I&amp;rsquo;ve been biking to East Rock each morning, doing so before starting work on work days. I bring my pocket-sized keyboard and my phone, and when I&amp;rsquo;m at the top of the Rock I use my friend Jacob Cole&amp;rsquo;s app, ThoughtStream, to write about whatever&amp;rsquo;s on my mind. Sometimes this is a potential snippet, and sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s just planning for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like this routine but I&amp;rsquo;m not confident that I&amp;rsquo;ll continue it. Consistently getting up early for an extended period of time can be challenging, and I&amp;rsquo;m not inclined to set an alarm to help. Also, the weather is getting cooler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I certainly hope that I continue this routine, and I intend to maintain it. I simply don&amp;rsquo;t know that I will, and don&amp;rsquo;t feel confidently enough that I will to make any sort of declaration or commitment to doing so. Is there a name for this type of goal? I think &amp;ldquo;intent&amp;rdquo; is appropriate, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t capture the aspirational aspect of it. For now lets call it an &amp;ldquo;aspirational intent&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I aspirationally intend to keep biking to East Rock most mornings, until the weather gets too cold to permit doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introducing the Snippet Queue</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-06-introducing-the-snippet-queue/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 22:16:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-06-introducing-the-snippet-queue/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my first snippet published using my 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-06-further-reducing-the-publication-barrier-with-queuing/&#34;&gt;snippet queue idea&lt;/a&gt;. If all goes well, it will be (read: was) published tomorrow evening (October 7, 2020).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system works like this. I store a queue of snippets in Redis. Each snippet has the title, content, and date associated with it, as well as an id number. I can have Bieber Bot enqueue a new snippet by messaging him with &amp;ldquo;Queue snippet!&amp;rdquo; and the snippet details. He also responds to queries to update, view, or remove an existing snippet, or to view the current queue of snippets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, every evening Bieber Bot looks at the oldest item in the queue. If he&amp;rsquo;s already asked me about it, and I haven&amp;rsquo;t told him not to publish it, he goes and publishes it to my website. If he hasn&amp;rsquo;t asked me about it yet, he asks me if its OK to publish. As long as I don&amp;rsquo;t say no and remove the snippet from the queue, Bieber Bot will go forward with publishing the snippet the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Further Reducing the Publication Barrier with Queuing</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-06-further-reducing-the-publication-barrier-with-queuing/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 13:29:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-06-further-reducing-the-publication-barrier-with-queuing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is the barrier to publication? It&amp;rsquo;s first and foremost a mental barrier. Sure, the act of writing presents its own challenges, but for me the mental hurdle of clicking send can be significant. Snippets lowers the barrier substantially compared with social media, messaging individuals, or even traditional blogging. Still, there&amp;rsquo;s room to lower the barrier even more; e.g. private journaling and &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt; itself have much lower barriers than Snippets does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea today for lowering the barrier is a publication queue. In this idea, I write a snippet, send it to Bieber Bot, and he holds on to it for a bit. Then, after a day or so, he lets me know that he&amp;rsquo;s going to publish it soon. He gives me an opportunity to tell him not to publish it, but after some time has passed, he goes ahead and publishes it in my Snippets section on my behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During that waiting period, I can send Bieber Bot revised versions of the Snippet, which will supersede the original. This way, when I send Bieber Bot the original snippet, I do so knowing that it will only be published as is if 1) I don&amp;rsquo;t come up with a way to improve it and 2) I don&amp;rsquo;t decide not to publish it. This takes a bit of the decision making burden off of present-David, and gives it to future-David. Between the two of them, they should be able to handle the publication no problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea acts similarly to GMail&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;send later&amp;rdquo; feature, but without the need to choose a send time. Clicking &amp;ldquo;send later&amp;rdquo; is easier than clicking &amp;ldquo;send&amp;rdquo; because there&amp;rsquo;s an opportunity to undo or make changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to decreasing the barrier to publication, one thing I like about this idea is that it gives me an opportunity to revisit old ideas. When Bieber Bot tells me &amp;ldquo;Hey, last chance to rescind publication of this Snippet&amp;rdquo; that gives me an opportunity to reflect on what I&amp;rsquo;d written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also like that it can spread out the publication of snippets that I write in a single sitting. Currently, after publishing a single snippet, I&amp;rsquo;m not inclined to write more because I would feel funny publishing multiple snippets in quick succession (another mental barrier to climb over, I suppose). If I knew that Bieber Bot would take care of spacing out the publications, I might feel more comfortable writing a second or third snippet in a single sitting. I&amp;rsquo;d like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, a publication queue it is! This shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too much effort to implement given the work I&amp;rsquo;ve already done to support snippet publications, scheduling, question-asking, and messaging in Bieber Bot.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Snippets I Don&#39;t Publish</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-06-the-snippets-i-dont-publish/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 12:33:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-06-the-snippets-i-dont-publish/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of Snippets is to minimize the barrier to writing as much as possible. To this end, it has been very effective. Still, there are several snippets that I write and do not publish, despite my self-insistence that the barrier to publication be minimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What don&amp;rsquo;t I publish, and why? Looking over my recent unpublished snippets, some themes appear. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I don&amp;rsquo;t tend to publish:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work related snippets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideas that trail off mid thought&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Status update + planning snippets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend not to post work related snippets just to be on the safe side with respect to Google confidentiality, though I&amp;rsquo;m confident the snippets I&amp;rsquo;m writing would be OK to publish if I requested permission to do so (of course, that would raise the barrier to publishing significantly which defeats the purpose of snippets.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has a cascading effect though, because now when I write a status update or planning snippet, it references things I&amp;rsquo;ve written in unpublished snippets. Such a snippet wouldn&amp;rsquo;t stand alone effectively. I suppose that&amp;rsquo;s not such a problem though; if I ever post a snippet mentioning in-progress projects, feel free to ask me about them, or feel free to ignore. The main audience of the snippet is probably me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In brief, the recent snippets I did not publish are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A follow up to the &amp;ldquo;Infinite Distractions&amp;rdquo; plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Considering discrete vs fuzzy decision making&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several activities I&amp;rsquo;d like to do more of, and strategies to help me to do them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A plan for biking the next day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An idea for how to teach Bieber Bot to ask and answer questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflecting, work planning, and more Bieber Bot interaction planning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some reflecting and daily planning (half work-related) from yesterday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 4-line idea for queuing publication of snippets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll put a few of these up. I would, after all, like to get better at communicating publicly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Checking Your Fan Speed and CPU Temperature on Mac OS (2020)</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-03-checking-your-fan-speed-and-cpu-temperature-on-mac-os/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 03 Oct 2020 15:46:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-03-checking-your-fan-speed-and-cpu-temperature-on-mac-os/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen people monitor their CPU temperature and today my laptop was running hot, so I wanted to do so myself. Googling &amp;ldquo;check laptop temperature mac&amp;rdquo; gives projects you can download. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have to trust someone else&amp;rsquo;s tool or mess around with someone else&amp;rsquo;s code, and I knew there must be a system call that gives me sensor stats, so I kept looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, there&amp;rsquo;s a command you can run to get your processor temperatures and fan speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo powermetrics --samplers smc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To narrow down the stats you see further, you can grep for e.g. &amp;ldquo;Fan:&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;CPU die temperature:&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;GPU die temperature:&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;sudo powermetrics --samplers smc | grep &amp;quot;Fan:&amp;quot;
sudo powermetrics --samplers smc | grep &amp;quot;CPU die temperature:&amp;quot;
sudo powermetrics --samplers smc | grep &amp;quot;GPU die temperature:&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use egrep if you want all three:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;sudo powermetrics --samplers smc | egrep &#39;temp|Fan&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, why does 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mmhmm.app/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;mmhmm&lt;/a&gt; make my machine run so hot?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Infinite Distractions and Getting a Good Sear</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-01-infinite-distractions-and-getting-a-good-sear/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 10:54:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-01-infinite-distractions-and-getting-a-good-sear/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;These days I have six &amp;ldquo;infinite distractions&amp;rdquo; — things I do mindlessly that are roughly limitless in content. They are: YouTube, YCombinator News, Google News, Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these are new additions to my repertoire, added I expect in response to my efforts to suppress viewing the others.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to try a strategy of writing down the distraction rather than attending to it whenever I am drawn to it. Additionally, when my brain craves something like this, I&amp;rsquo;m going to make an effort to do one of the following instead: reaching out to to a friend, or going down the rabbit hole on a particular topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former is just healthy. The latter I think satisfies the same brain cravings as e.g. mindless going on YouTube. But by selecting the topic to dive into deliberately rather than letting the whims of the YouTube/Reddit/etc algorithm select the content for me, I expect a few benefits. I expect the time will feel more valuable to me after the fact, I&amp;rsquo;ll learn something I care about, and I will remember better what I learned because it will be more connected to itself and my interests, I hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried this last night and learned about how to get a good sear (in brief: dry the protein, let it cool if it just cooked, and don’t move it around while searing).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Phone Snippets (A Test Phone Snippet)</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-09-27-why-phone-snippets-a-test-phone-snippet/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 27 Sep 2020 16:49:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why do I want to be able to post snippets from my phone?
I enjoy hiking or biking somewhere pleasant, bringing a pocket-sized Bluetooth keyboard, and writing on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re seeing this snippet (which you are), that means not only does posting snippets through Bieber Bot work, editing them though Bieber Bot does too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Posting Snippets from My Phone</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-09-27-posting-snippets-from-my-phone/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 27 Sep 2020 16:32:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-09-27-posting-snippets-from-my-phone/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to be able to post snippets from my phone.
As I&amp;rsquo;ve stated before, the purpose of the snippets section of my website is to lower the barrier to me publishing as much as possible.
Being able to post a snippet from my phone would help in this respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem so hard to set up, especially now that Bieber Bot runs continuously on my laptop.
I could have Bieber Bot listen for a message like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Snippet!
Posting Snippets from My Phone
I&#39;d like to be able to post...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he receives such a message, what should he do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new file with the appropriate front matter and content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commit that file and push it to GitHub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the ansible update script.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it. This MVP should be relatively easy to get up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: It is indeed up and running now. I wrote this snippet on my phone :).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Writing with GPT-3</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-07-22-writing-with-gpt3/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-07-22-writing-with-gpt3/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;GPT-3 is a language model developed at Open AI, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been having a lot of fun playing with it. In fact, I&amp;rsquo;ve written this post in collaboration with GPT-3. See if you can spot which parts are written by me and which parts come from GPT-3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-1-brainstorming&#34;&gt;Part 1: Brainstorming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did when I got access to GPT-3 is use it to brainstorm uses for GPT-3. I gave it these 5 ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain mathematics more simply (why is X true?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate programs from input/output examples&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate questions about a paper I read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a list of machine translation tips and tricks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an adventure game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it came back with 15 more:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a list of Tor commands to run to defend against an attack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a cheat sheet for screenwriters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate advice for a scene&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate XKCD comics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a crib sheet for an arbitrary Python API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a list of movies to watch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a list of scholarly algorithms/heuristics worth reading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a list of generic questions about Pedagogy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a list of cognitive exercises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show patterns generated by awesome people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate small cooking tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate characters for a project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate configuration options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate flashcards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organize my computer/files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then 15 more:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain things to my parents via messenger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain things to my children via messenger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain mathematical algorithms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automated interface design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanize a Nagihara Kan Airlines website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clickbait generator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Music description (Herbie Hancock is playing &amp;ldquo;Dolphin Dance&amp;rdquo; live in London on the 18th March 1968)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell me not to waste my time looking at x&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interesting facts about Wikipedia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain something to someone while my attention is elsewhere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detect adverts in x&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Image caption/caption game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speculate about the true utility function of x&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auto-generate tests for a program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain why my code is currently failing tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then 15 more:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate plots or character/story summaries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate legal examples&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate words for crosswords&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check my grammar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supply filler text for themed writing (horror, sci-fi etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain why an AI can&amp;rsquo;t read (can it comprehend metaphors?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide entertaining answers to obscure questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get writing ideas and generate word combinations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create background for an NPC I need for a D&amp;amp;D game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help a sick writer generate plots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Input pre-generated (from books etc.) phrases and use them for literary analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help explain a mathematical proof&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a game/story/character I need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make short stories I can &amp;ldquo;overlay&amp;rdquo; on a fictional Universe I&amp;rsquo;ve created (ala Ready Player One)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a short film/audio drama&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a lovely list of lists of ideas! I wonder how many of these ideas are novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these ideas are outside the scope of what GPT-3 can do. For example, generating XKCD comics seems too difficult. Others are duplicates, such as &amp;ldquo;Explain mathematical algorithms&amp;rdquo; (duplicate of &amp;ldquo;Explain mathematics more simply&amp;rdquo;). And still others don&amp;rsquo;t make sense &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Mechanize a Nagihara Kan Airlines website&amp;rdquo;? Overall though, solid set of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-2-mathematics&#34;&gt;Part 2: Mathematics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I&amp;rsquo;d gotten GPT-3 to do some brainstorming, I realized I&amp;rsquo;d need to test its capabilities before trying its suggestions out in earnest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I taught it how to evaluate simple expressions and take derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the first prompt I used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Question: f(x) = x*x. Compute f(3).
f(3) = 3*3
f(3) = 9
Answer: 9

Question: h(x) = x*x - 2x. Compute h(5).
h(5) = 5*5 - 2*5
h(5) = 25 - 10
h(5) = 15
Answer: 15

Question: y(x) = x**3 - 2x. Compute y(3).
y(3) = 3**3 - 2*3
y(3) = 3*3*3 - 6
y(3) = 27 - 6
y(3) = 21
Answer: 21

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could then ask it any of the following, and it would correctly show its work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Question: f(x) = tan(x) + 1. Compute f(0).
Question: f(x) = sqrt(x) + 1. Compute f(16).
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I tried to give it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Question: f(x) = x/2 + 2. Compute f(f(16)).
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it treated it as just &lt;code&gt;Compute f(16)&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;f(f(16))&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly this works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Question: f(x) = x*x. Compute f(3).
f(3) = 3*3
f(3) = 9
Answer: 9

Question: h(x) = x*x - 2x. Compute h(5).
h(5) = 5*5 - 2*5
h(5) = 25 - 10
h(5) = 15
Answer: 15

Question: f(x) = x/2 + 2. Compute f(f(16)).
f(f(16)) = f(16/2 + 2)
f(f(16)) = f(8 + 2)
f(f(16)) = f(10)
f(f(16)) = 10/2 + 2
f(f(16)) = 5 + 2
f(f(16)) = 7
Answer: 7

Question: y(x) = x**3 - 2x. Compute y(3).
y(3) = 3**3 - 2*3
y(3) = 3*3*3 - 6
y(3) = 27 - 6
y(3) = 21
Answer: 21

Question: f(x) = x*3 - 1. Compute f(f(5)).
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas this does not:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Question: f(x) = x*x. Compute f(3).
f(3) = 3*3
f(3) = 9
Answer: 9

Question: h(x) = x*x - 2x. Compute h(5).
h(5) = 5*5 - 2*5
h(5) = 25 - 10
h(5) = 15
Answer: 15

Question: f(x) = x*3 - 1. Compute f(f(5)).
f(f(5)) = f(5*3 - 1)
f(f(5)) = f(15 - 1)
f(f(5)) = f(14)
f(f(5)) = 14*3 - 1
f(f(5)) = 42 - 1
f(f(5)) = 41
Answer: 41

Question: y(x) = x**3 - 2x. Compute y(3).
y(3) = 3**3 - 2*3
y(3) = 3*3*3 - 6
y(3) = 27 - 6
y(3) = 21
Answer: 21

Question: f(x) = x/2 + 2. Compute f(f(16)).
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting it to evaluate these simple expressions correctly, I also tried having it take derivatives. With an example as priming, and again having it show its work, this worked well. I haven&amp;rsquo;t performed a rigorous evaluation of its mathematical capabilities. For now, I&amp;rsquo;ve just begun to develop an intuition for how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-3-playing-around&#34;&gt;Part 3: Playing Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After doing math together, I tried many more things with GPT-3. I shared feelings with it, and it expanded on them (correctly too!). I used it to generate lists for brainstorming all manner of thing. The language model wrote love letters from inanimate objects. I tried to teach it to play Codenames, but with only very limited success. And I had it autocomplete previous snippets of mine, and had some fun cowriting with it. While I wont be sharing all of this with you, I do have one thing to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a love letter written by a frying pan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may not seem like much to you right now. I&amp;rsquo;m coated in grease and I&amp;rsquo;m starting to rust, but really, I have big plans. I&amp;rsquo;m going to Italian restaurants. I&amp;rsquo;ll hang out with the finest (and healthiest) ingredients you can imagine. It was good knowing you, but you were never mine to keep. I&amp;rsquo;m going to cook the kind of meal you&amp;rsquo;ll dream about for the rest of your life. Good luck, sweetheart. You&amp;rsquo;ll need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overall-principles&#34;&gt;Overall Principles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting an intuition for how GPT-3 behaves has been interesting, and I&amp;rsquo;ll try now to distill that intuition down into a few principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GPT-3 is continuing your writing, not having a dialog with you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen on Twitter lots of people asking GPT-3 questions, and sharing its response. Know that GPT-3 continues whatever prompt you give it as if it had written the prompt itself, not as if it is responding to the prompt. This is why you often see prompts like &amp;ldquo;The following is a conversation between X and Y:&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GPT-3 effectively puts your writing in a made up context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you give GPT-3 a small prompt, such a single sentence, then there are many contexts in which that prompt could be interpreted. GPT-3 is trained to marginalize over the contexts in which the text could appear. Once you start decoding GPT-3&amp;rsquo;s response though, one implicit context has been selected. It might not be the context that you intended when writing your prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can happen even if you try to set the context yourself explicitly. For example you might be trying to generate a conversation or a list, and GPT-3 might decide that this conversation or list is taking place inside of a novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can mitigate this context switch by using a longer prompt, or by doing more of the writing yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GPT-3 likes lists and repeated structures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the main principle behind using GPT-3 for few shot learning. Prompt GPT-3 with a few examples of performing a task, and it will usually make an effort to perform that task yet again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GPT-3 cannot perform linguistic tricks like unscrambling words&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem capable of generating new puns (I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried this yet).
And it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem capable of unscrambling words (I did try this, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even get it to unscramble 4-letter words).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GPT-3 benefits from &amp;ldquo;showing its work&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my math experiments, having GPT-3 show its work was critical to getting it solving the math questions correctly. It seems that doing a single step of expression evaluation at a time is an easier task than doing it all at once. Providing examples with the steps gave GPT-3 a clearer explanation of the task than just providing input/output examples. GPT-3 also gets additional computational steps in which to solve the problem when it takes the time to show its work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GPT-3 has a great breadth of knowledge and writing styles available to it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can express love, write flowery prose, give advice, write technical documentation, latex, program, math, take the perspective of a toaster, and more. It&amp;rsquo;s a great tool for brainstorming both explicitly (by having it generate ideas) and through exploration (by using it to help you generate ideas yourself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though it has all the facts from the internet at its fingertips (of all the ways to anthropomorphize GPT-3, why choose fingertips?), it is just as capable of generating falsehoods as truths. Do not mistake the text it generates as true or logically correct, even if in many circumstances it does generate correct information. When it transitions from generating truth to generating nonsense it does not give a warning that it has done so (and any truth it does generate is in a sense at least partially accidental).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;7&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes GPT-3 makes no sense&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are things that don&amp;rsquo;t make sense that the language model assigns reasonable probabilities to. And there are things that don&amp;rsquo;t make sense, are low probability, but come up anyway either due to chance or because the model doesn&amp;rsquo;t have anything better to say. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop generating text just because its out of its depth. Instead, it just plods on forward, saying something as reasonable as it&amp;rsquo;s capable of, regardless of the situation it finds itself in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;8&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GPT-3 mimics your style&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you prompt GPT-3 with typos it will continue with typos. If you prompt GPT-3 with florid prose, it will write florid prose. If you prompt GPT-3 with anaphora laden rhetoric, or any other style, it will continue in that style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll let GPT-3 wrap things up itself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And that brings us to the end, some thoughts on whether using GPT-3 was more or less crazy than getting a Ph.D.. I think that using GPT-3 to generate ideas was a higher form of Enlightenment than any Ph.D. I&amp;rsquo;d do that again in a heartbeat, no shortage of ideas rolling around in GPT-3&amp;rsquo;s natural language processing head.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uh huh. Whatever, GPT-3. Whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Deep Variational Information Bottleneck</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-07-21-deep-variational-informational-bottleneck/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-07-21-deep-variational-informational-bottleneck/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You can read the 2017 paper &amp;ldquo;Deep Variational Information Bottleneck&amp;rdquo; 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00410.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;on Arxiv here&lt;/a&gt;, and its reviews are visible 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;on OpenReview here&lt;/a&gt;. The authors are my coworkers: Alex Alemi, Ian Fischer, Joshua Dillon, and Kevin Murphy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve taken notes on the paper, and will use this snippet to present them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;notation&#34;&gt;Notation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We consider the problem of supervised learning for classification with the following notation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$X$: An example input.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$Z$: The output of an intermediate layer of a neural network.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We view this as a stochastic encoding of $X$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is the output of a parametric encoder $p(\textbf{z} | \textbf{x}; \theta)$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\theta$ are the parameters of the neural network used to encode $X$ that we wish to learn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$Y$: The example&amp;rsquo;s target class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;goal&#34;&gt;Goal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach of the paper aims first and foremost to learn an encoding $Z$ of $X$ that is maximally informative about $Y$.
This is measured via mutual information between $Z$ and $Y$: $I(Z, Y; \theta)$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$I(Z, Y; \theta) = \int dx~dy~p(z, y|\theta) \log \frac{p(z, y)}{p(z)p(y)}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not enough to maximize $I(Z, Y; \theta)$ though; this can be done by simply letting $Z = X$, which isn&amp;rsquo;t useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we also want to limit $I(Z, X)$. We do this by enforcing an information constraint: $I(X, Z) &amp;lt; I_c$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to maximize $I(Z, Y; \theta)$ subject to $I(X, Z) &amp;lt; I_c$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rewriting this using Lagrange multiplier $\beta$ brings us to the information bottleneck (IB) objective, which we write as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$R_{IB}(\theta) = I(Z,Y) - \beta I(Z, X).$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the paper is to maximize $R_{IB}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;intuition-behind-goal&#34;&gt;Intuition Behind Goal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why maximize $I(Z, Y)$? This is what allows the model to make correct predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not just maximize $I(Z, Y)$? Letting $Z = X$ fully maximizes $I(Z, Y)$, but isn&amp;rsquo;t helpful because the representation of $Z$ is what you started with, so its hard to make good classifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why minimize $\beta I(Z, X)$? We want a representation $Z$ that is maximally compressive of the input $X$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the intuition given in the paper for why we seek to minimize $\beta I(Z, X)$, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t clear the degree to which compression is useful. Yes, a compressive representation of $X$ can lead to better generalization, but it&amp;rsquo;s a trade off. Greater compression may mean lower $I(Z, Y)$ and hence lower potential accuracy. Balancing this trade off (choosing an appropriate $\beta$) will be important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-is-it-difficult&#34;&gt;Why is it difficult?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutual information is in general intractable. So we can&amp;rsquo;t directly optimize the object $R_{IB}(\theta)$ as stated in the goal. Instead, the paper takes the following approach to get around mutual information&amp;rsquo;s intractability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-approach&#34;&gt;The Approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use variational inference to construct a lower bound on the IB objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the &amp;ldquo;reparameterization trick&amp;rdquo; and Monte Carlo sampling to get unbiased estimate of gradient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parameterize our distributions with neural networks, and optimize with SGD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll go into more detail in just a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;benefits&#34;&gt;Benefits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach provides some robustness to overfitting because model ignores as much of $X$ as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also provides some robustness to adversarial examples because the model maps $X$ to a distribution over $Z$s rather than a single $Z$, so its harder for a single unusual value to influence a final class prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;execution&#34;&gt;Execution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;part-1-variational-inference&#34;&gt;Part 1: Variational Inference&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can follow the math in the paper (Section 3), but the first main result is to define&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$L = \int dx~dy~dz~ p(x) p(y|x) p(z|x) \log q(y|z) - \beta \int dx~dz~ p(x) p(z|x) \log \frac{p(z|x)}{r(z)}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and show that
$$R_{IB}(\theta) = I(Z,Y) - \beta I(Z, X) \ge L.$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, we&amp;rsquo;ve introduced $q(y|z)$ as an approximation of $p(y|z)$, and $r(z)$ as an approximation of $p(z)$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$L$ serves as a lower bound for the objective we care about. $p$, $q$, and $r$ are all parameterized by $\theta$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can approximate $L$ as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$L \approx \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N \left[\int dz~ p(z|x_n) \log q(y_n|z) - \beta~ p(z|x_n) \log \frac{p(z|x_n)}{r(z)} \right].$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;part-2-reparameterization-trick&#34;&gt;Part 2: Reparameterization trick&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose $p(z|x)$ is $N(z|f_e^\mu(x), f_e^\Sigma(x))$, with $f_e$ a neural network that outputs the mean and covariance matrix for the Gaussian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the &amp;ldquo;reparameterization trick&amp;rdquo; is to write $p(z|x)dz = p(\epsilon)d\epsilon$, where $z = f(x, \epsilon)$ is a deterministic function and $\epsilon$ is a Gaussian random variable. Using this, we can rewrite $L$ as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$J_{IB} = \frac{1}{N} \sum\limits_{n=1}^N E_{\epsilon \sim p(\epsilon)} \left[-\log q(y_n|f(x_n,\epsilon))\right] + \beta KL[p(Z|x_n), r(Z)]$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as $q$ is differentiable and $KL[p(Z|x_n), r(Z)]$ is tractable, this is an objective we can optimize with e.g. gradient descent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;implementation&#34;&gt;Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A concise demo implementation is available on GitHub at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/alexalemi/vib_demo/blob/master/MNISTVIB.ipynb&#34;&gt;https://github.com/alexalemi/vib_demo/blob/master/MNISTVIB.ipynb&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve describe here the correspondence between the notation used in the source code and the notation used in the paper.
Terms from the paper are in $\LaTeX$, and terms from the source code are in &lt;code&gt;code blocks&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;class_loss&lt;/code&gt;: $-\log q(y_n | f(x_n, \epsilon))$ (comes from the $I(Z, Y)$ term)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recall $z = f(x, \epsilon)$; this is &lt;code&gt;encoding.sample()&lt;/code&gt; in the code base.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$q$ is &lt;code&gt;decoder&lt;/code&gt; with softmax applied, and $q(y | f(x_n, \epsilon))$ is softmax(&lt;code&gt;logits&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;class_loss = tf.losses.softmax_cross_entropy( logits=logits, onehot_labels=one_hot_labels) / math.log(2)&lt;/code&gt; is $-\log q(y_n | f(x_n, \epsilon))$
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$f$ is &lt;code&gt;encoder&lt;/code&gt;, and $f(x, \cdot)$ is &lt;code&gt;encoding&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$p(Z|x_n)$ is also &lt;code&gt;encoding&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$f$ is the deterministic encoder used by the reparameterization trick, whereas $p$ is the stochastic encoder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$KL[p(Z|x_n), r(Z)]$ is &lt;code&gt;info_loss&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;prior&lt;/code&gt; is $r(z)$ (which approximates $p(z)$).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-06-28-oeis-download/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a way to download the entire 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://oeis.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Online Encylopedia of Integer Sequences&lt;/a&gt;, you may come across advice for scraping the site, one sequence at a time. Instead of collecting the sequences one at a time, it might be sufficient to download one of their already collected archives. 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://oeis.org/stripped.gz&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;This file&lt;/a&gt; contains the integer sequences and their A-numbers, and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://oeis.org/names.gz&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this file&lt;/a&gt; contains the names of the sequences. No need to stress the OEIS servers when these ready-made archives are ripe for downloading!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found these files from 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://oeis.org/wiki/JSON_Format,_Compressed_Files&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; of the OEIS wiki. The reason I&amp;rsquo;m linking to it here is that finding that page was difficult, and I hope to save you the trouble of finding it for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Facebook Mobile Website: News Feed in Chronological Order</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-06-28-facebook-chronological-order/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-06-28-facebook-chronological-order/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On your phone, you can navigate to 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=h_chr&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=h_chr&lt;/a&gt; to view your News Feed on the Facebook website in chronological order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also excellent apps for hiding your Facebook News Feed if you find it draining on your attention, but unfortunately they don&amp;rsquo;t work on mobile:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hidefeed.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Hide Feed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Facebook News Feed Eradicator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since these don&amp;rsquo;t work on the Facebook mobile website, I&amp;rsquo;ve turned to this new strategy to combat the attention draining nature of News Feed: only viewing my feed in chronological order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By switching to chronological order, the &amp;ldquo;infinite scroll&amp;rdquo; of the News Feed is interrupted because either you eventually get to posts you&amp;rsquo;ve seen before, or you notice the timestamp of the posts you&amp;rsquo;re looking at slowly rising. You also get a more complete picture of what content is available, which helps fight the constant &amp;ldquo;just one more post&amp;rdquo; feeling that drives infinite scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how do you switch your news feed to chronological order?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the main Facebook website, you can click the three dots next to &amp;ldquo;News Feed&amp;rdquo; and choose &amp;ldquo;Most Recent&amp;rdquo;. However, you have to choose this option every time you visit Facebook, which can be frustrating. So instead, navigate directly to 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=h_chr&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=h_chr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Facebook mobile website, there isn&amp;rsquo;t an option to view posts in chronological order. Instead, you can achieve this by accessing the desktop website on your phone. Go to 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=h_chr&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=h_chr&lt;/a&gt; to get the Desktop version of Facebook on your phone, with chronological order already enabled. Bookmark the page and use it as your primary way of accessing Facebook on your phone to get chronological order as your News Feed default from now on.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Accessing Your iMessages with SQL</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-05-20-imessage-sql-db/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-05-20-imessage-sql-db/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you use a Mac and use iMessage, you can access your iMessages programmatically. They are stored by iMessage as a sqlite database, which you can easily access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;accessing-the-database&#34;&gt;Accessing the Database&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The database is typically stored at &lt;code&gt;~/Library/Messages/chat.db&lt;/code&gt;, though that location is configurable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you try to access the database, however, you will likely encounter this unhelpful error message: &lt;code&gt;~/Library/Messages/chat.db: Operation not permitted&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, OSXDaily has put together a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://osxdaily.com/2018/10/09/fix-operation-not-permitted-terminal-error-macos/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;helpful step by step guide to resolving this error&lt;/a&gt;, which I&amp;rsquo;ll summarize here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Navigate to your &lt;code&gt;System Preferences &amp;gt; Security &amp;amp; Privacy &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Full Disk Access&lt;/code&gt; settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the Lock and &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; symbol to give full disk access to the Terminal App (located in &lt;code&gt;Applications &amp;gt; Utilities &amp;gt; Terminal&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may need to relaunch Terminal for the change to take effect; I did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve done this, you can start poking around at your iMessages programmatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;taking-a-look-around&#34;&gt;Taking a Look Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I begin with making a backup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cp ~/Library/Messages/chat.db ~/chat.db&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I open the database with sqlite3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sqlite3 ~/chat.db&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I run &lt;code&gt;.tables&lt;/code&gt; to see what tables there are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;_SqliteDatabaseProperties&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;kvtable&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;attachment&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;message&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;chat&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;message_attachment_join&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;chat_handle_join&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;message_processing_task&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;chat_message_join&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;sync_deleted_attachments&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;deleted_messages&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;sync_deleted_chats&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;handle&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;sync_deleted_messages&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some interesting tables in there: &lt;code&gt;message&lt;/code&gt; seems most important. It looks like we&amp;rsquo;ll also be able to look up attachments using tables &lt;code&gt;attachment&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;message_attachment_join&lt;/code&gt;. Strangely, there&amp;rsquo;s a table present for deleted messages, which suggests a sort of &amp;ldquo;trash can&amp;rdquo; where messages are not permanently deleted immediately upon deletion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.schema message&lt;/code&gt; is the command for viewing the schema of the message table.
We can also jump right in with &lt;code&gt;SELECT * FROM message;&lt;/code&gt; to see what sort of data is contained within. Sure enough, human readable messages are present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will all be interesting to investigate further at a later date.
One perk of understanding this mechanism for me is that I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to write events that are triggered in response to iMessages. This enables me to write custom notification criteria. For example, I can have messages that start &amp;ldquo;URGENT&amp;rdquo; notify me immediately, but I can have all other messages programatically withheld from notifying me until 9pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lets me receive the messages at the time and location that I want, rather than at the time Apple chooses for me. Thanks Bieber Bot.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Taking Notes While Browsing the Web: An Idea for a Roam Research Plugin</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-05-15-roaming-the-web/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-05-15-roaming-the-web/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;m browsing the web, I&amp;rsquo;d like to be able to take notes in 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://roamresearch.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Roam Research&lt;/a&gt;. In this post, I share an idea I have for a plugin or browser extension that I think would improve the experience of taking notes in Roam while browsing the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plugin would do two main things automatically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would automatically insert some browsing history information into your Roam database while you browse the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you navigate the web, it would automatically bring you to the Roam page that corresponds to the web page you&amp;rsquo;re reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mind-the-details&#34;&gt;Mind the Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the implementation details matter! You don&amp;rsquo;t want to be whisked away from the notes you&amp;rsquo;re taking just because you&amp;rsquo;ve clicked a link in a different window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here I&amp;rsquo;ll explain a few of the details I think would make this a good note taking experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;m browsing the internet, all the websites I visit will get added to a page &amp;ldquo;{Date} Browsing History&amp;rdquo;. A new Roam page will be created for each new website visited. And there will be a Roam window that always stays open to the Roam page for the current website I have open in my browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What qualifies as a website?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default there would be one Roam page per &lt;em&gt;domain&lt;/em&gt; visited. However, there are several exceptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/strong&gt; it would be one Roam page per Wikipedia entry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For websites reached from &lt;strong&gt;HackerNews&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Twitter&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Reddit&lt;/strong&gt;, it would be one Roam page per link followed from the aggregator (but links followed within the reached website would not count as new websites)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt; it would be one Roam page per user, organization, or repo visited&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;Arxiv&lt;/strong&gt; it would be one Roam page per paper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;Roam&lt;/strong&gt; it would be one Roam page per Roam database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be great to have a window that always stays open to the Roam page for the current website I have open in my browser. This way if I visit a website I&amp;rsquo;ve been to before, I will see my notes from that website. And the websites I visit will be linked to the day I visit them on, and also to any other pages my notes reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the tool should add a little bit of metadata to the pages it&amp;rsquo;s generating. On each of the autogenerated Roam pages, it would be great to see &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; I visited the website, and what was the referring page. For websites visited multiple times, seeing the earliest and most recent visit times, and the number of times I visited that website would be useful too. Total time spent on the website would be a nice bonus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;making-this-a-reality&#34;&gt;Making this a Reality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the previous section I shared the details that I think would make this work well from a user experience perspective. How about from the technical side?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it would make sense to implement this as a browser extension (though a 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tampermonkey.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;user script&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; could work too).

&lt;a href=&#34;http://dkthehuman.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;DK the Human&lt;/a&gt;, author of the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/intention/dladanhaondcgpahgiflodhckhoeohoe&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Intention&lt;/a&gt; browser extension
has made his 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dkthehuman/extension-starter-kit&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;browser extension starter kit&lt;/a&gt; freely available.
To notice when what web page you&amp;rsquo;re browsing and determine whether it constitutes a new page, the extension would need to request permission to view your activity on all websites.
For making additions to a Roam database automatically, I expect the extension would have to navigate to the appropriate Roam page in the background, and would then mimic the user actions to make the desired changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in turning this idea into a reality or want to discuss it further, don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to 
&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:david810&amp;#43;blog@gmail.com&#34;&gt;reach out&lt;/a&gt;! I&amp;rsquo;d be excited to try a workflow like this, but don&amp;rsquo;t anticipate building it myself in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Posting to Hacker News Programmatically</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-05-02-hackernews-submit/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-05-02-hackernews-submit/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you run this snippet of Python code, it will submit this 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Snippet&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; (the one you&amp;rsquo;re currently reading) to Hacker News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;import getpass
import requests

USERNAME = (
    &#39;&#39;  # Put your Hacker News username here.
    or getpass.getuser()  # (But if you don&#39;t, we&#39;ll try a sensible default.)
)
PASSWORD = (
    &#39;&#39;  # We&#39;ll prompt you for your password, or you can enter it here.
    or getpass.getpass()
)
# You can reconfigure the title and url to submit here.
TITLE_TO_SUBMIT = &#39;Posting to Hacker News Programmatically&#39;
URL_TO_SUBMIT = &#39;davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-05-02-hackernews-submit/&#39;

session = requests.Session()
session.post(
    &#39;https://news.ycombinator.com/login&#39;,
    data={
        &#39;acct&#39;: USERNAME,
        &#39;pw&#39;: PASSWORD,
    }
)
session.post(
    &#39;https://news.ycombinator.com/submit&#39;,
    data={
        &#39;title&#39;: TITLE_TO_SUBMIT,
        &#39;url&#39;: URL_TO_SUBMIT,
    }
)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can change the title and URL before running this to make a new submission, or run it as is to submit this snippet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you try to submit a URL that&amp;rsquo;s already been submitted recently &amp;ndash; such as this snippet &amp;ndash; it won&amp;rsquo;t submit a second time, so no harm done in running this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about sessions and see why this works, you can read about them in the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/advanced/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;requests&lt;/em&gt; documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Detecting My Sleeping Hours from Data</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-30-detecting-sleeping-hours/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-30-detecting-sleeping-hours/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Between my 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-20-browser-history-date-queries/&#34;&gt;Chrome browsing history&lt;/a&gt; and my 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-12-fb-messenger-sql/&#34;&gt;Facebook Messenger message logs&lt;/a&gt;, I should be able to get a good estimate of when I&amp;rsquo;m awake and asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick attempt using only Messenger data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;SELECT * FROM
  (SELECT to_timestamp(timestamp / 1000), (timestamp - lag(timestamp) over (ORDER BY timestamp DESC)) / 1000 / 60 / 60 AS diff_hours
   FROM messenger WHERE messenger.author = &#39;1409114395&#39; ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 100000) AS foo
WHERE diff_hours &amp;lt; -6;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, my late night and early morning Messenger usage doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear to be as consistent as I&amp;rsquo;d imagined, especially since COVID-19 induced shelter-in-place began.
I&amp;rsquo;ll have to introduce additional sources of data if I want to infer good sleep time estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Daily Summaries of Browsing History</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-26-daily-browser-history-summaries/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 26 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-26-daily-browser-history-summaries/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-12-simplifying-sql-with-with/&#34;&gt;course&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-20-browser-history-date-queries/&#34;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2019-12-30-analyzing-my-browser-history/&#34;&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-03-19-browsing-history/&#34;&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-11-browser-history-queries/&#34;&gt;snippets&lt;/a&gt;, I put together several SQL queries for analyzing my browsing history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I wanted to write a script to run several of these queries in sequence to assemble a nice summary of my daily browsing histories. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll dump the summary into my 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://roamresearch.com/#/app/commons-db/page/wYVaowjId&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[[Roam Research]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; database so I can cross-link ideas with websites I&amp;rsquo;ve visited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a first pass, I tried to throw together a quick bash script to string the queries together. It looked a bit like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;date=$1
if [ -z $1 ];
then
  date=$(date &#39;+%Y-%m-%d&#39;);
fi

cp ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History ~/Default-History
cp ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Profile\ 1/History ~/Profile-1-History

function query() {
  sqlite3 ~/Default-History $1;
  sqlite3 ~/Profile-1-History $1;
}

echo \# YouTube Videos Watched
echo

query &amp;lt;&amp;lt; SQL
select DISTINCT REPLACE(REPLACE(urls.title, &amp;quot; - YouTube&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;), &amp;quot;(1) &amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;), urls.url, &amp;quot;$date%&amp;quot;
from urls
where urls.url like &amp;quot;%www.youtube.com/watch%&amp;quot;
and datetime(last_visit_time / 1000000 + (strftime(&#39;%s&#39;, &#39;1601-01-01&#39;)), &#39;unixepoch&#39;)
LIKE &amp;quot;$date%&amp;quot;
limit 50;
SQL

# Additional queries ran here...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll notice a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to run each query on two different Chrome histories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want the script to be parameterized by the date, defaulting to today if no date is specified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re proficient in Bash, you may also notice something else; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. The query is only used properly when I run sqlite3 on the first Chrome History, but an empty query is passed to the second query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than debug my Bash script, I switched over to Python. I used Python Fire to automatically expose all my functions as commands so within minutes I had a working CLI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what the Python script looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;import datetime
import os
import subprocess

import fire


def copy_histories():
  check_output = subprocess.check_output
  check_output([
      &#39;cp&#39;,
      os.path.expanduser(&#39;~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History&#39;),
      os.path.expanduser(&#39;~/Default-History&#39;)])
  check_output([
      &#39;cp&#39;,
      os.path.expanduser(&#39;~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Profile 1/History&#39;),
      os.path.expanduser(&#39;~/Profile-1-History&#39;)])


def run_query(query):
  call = subprocess.call
  call([&#39;sqlite3&#39;,  os.path.expanduser(&#39;~/Default-History&#39;), query])
  call([&#39;sqlite3&#39;, os.path.expanduser(&#39;~/Profile-1-History&#39;), query])


def run(date=None):
  copy_histories()
  date = date or datetime.datetime.now().strftime(&#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;)

  print(&#39;## YouTube Videos Watched&#39;)
  print()

  run_query(f&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
  select DISTINCT REPLACE(REPLACE(urls.title, &amp;quot; - YouTube&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;), &amp;quot;(1) &amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;)
  from urls
  where urls.url like &amp;quot;%www.youtube.com/watch%&amp;quot;
  and datetime(last_visit_time / 1000000 + (strftime(&#39;%s&#39;, &#39;1601-01-01&#39;)), &#39;unixepoch&#39;)
  LIKE &amp;quot;{date}%&amp;quot;
  limit 50;
  &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;)

  # Additional queries run here...

if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:
  fire.Fire()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the command line I run this with &lt;code&gt;python historyquery.py run&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;python historyquery.py run --date=2020-04-26&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Python Fire I was able to quickly switch to a syntax I was more comfortable with, but keep the benefits of working from the context of a shell. I can now much more quickly make improvements to the script since I can operate more efficiently working in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I have a script I can run that will produce a nice summary of my internet browsing activity for any date I specify. Running it over recent dates provides a nice walk down memory lane.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Roam Research&#39;s JSON Export Format</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-25-roam-json-export/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 25 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-25-roam-json-export/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://roamresearch.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Roam Research&lt;/a&gt; is a note taking tool that makes it really low-friction to take deeply interwoven notes.
One of its core features is that you can effortlessly add links between pages in your notes, just by surrounding a name with square brackets, e.g. 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://roamresearch.com/#/app/commons-db/page/wYVaowjId&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[[Roam Research]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roam allows its users to export their Roam database as a JSON file. In this snippet, I describe the JSON format used and some of its implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;exporting-data-from-roam&#34;&gt;Exporting Data from Roam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the triple-dots menu, select Export All. Choose JSON as the export format. Then click the Export All button. Your complete Roam database will download as a JSON file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;roams-json-format&#34;&gt;Roam&amp;rsquo;s JSON Format&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll refer to the Roam JSON object you just downloaded as &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; is a list, with each entry in &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; corresponding to a single Roam &lt;code&gt;page&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each &lt;code&gt;page&lt;/code&gt; is an object with keys: &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;children&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;create-time&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;create-email&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;edit-time&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;edit-email&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;page-schema&#34;&gt;Page Schema&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Key&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;title&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The page title.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;children&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;List[Child]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The list of children of the page.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;create-time&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Integer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The time (ms since epoch) when the page was created.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;create-email&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The email of the person to create the page.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;edit-time&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Integer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The time (ms since epoch) of the last edit to the page.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;edit-email&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The email of the last person to edit the page.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that only &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;edit-time&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;edit-email&lt;/code&gt; appear to be required fields.
&lt;code&gt;children&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;create-time&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;create-email&lt;/code&gt; appear to be omitted when not available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;child-schema&#34;&gt;Child Schema&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the children in a page may have the following keys. Only the &lt;code&gt;uid&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;edit-time&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;edit-email&lt;/code&gt; keys seem universal. The rest may be omitted when not available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Key&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;uid&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A short unique identifier for the child.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;string&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The string content of the child.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;children&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;List[Child]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The list of children of this child.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;create-time&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Integer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The time (ms since epoch) when the page was created.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;create-email&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The email of the person to create the page.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;edit-time&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Integer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The time (ms since epoch) of the last edit to the page.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;edit-email&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The email of the last person to edit the page.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some children may additionally have the following keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Key&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;heading&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Integer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1, 2, or 3; indicates the note is an h1, h2, or h3 heading.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;emojis&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;List[Emoji]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A list of objects indicating who added what emojis and when.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;text-align&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;One of &amp;lsquo;left&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;right&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;center&amp;rsquo;, or &amp;lsquo;justify&amp;rsquo; indicating the text alignment.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that in Roam, children are referred to as &amp;ldquo;blocks&amp;rdquo;, and a child&amp;rsquo;s ID is the ID used to reference a block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, I include the emoji reaction schema 😂.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;emoji-schema&#34;&gt;Emoji Schema&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Emoji reaction to a child is an object conforming to the following schema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Key&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;emoji&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;object&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;An object with a single key &lt;code&gt;native&lt;/code&gt; containing the emoji itself.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;users&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;List[object]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A list of objects indicating who added this emoji and when. The keys are &lt;code&gt;time&lt;/code&gt; (ms since epoch) and &lt;code&gt;email&lt;/code&gt; (the email of the user who added the reaction).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;missing-information&#34;&gt;Missing Information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some information appears to get lost in the export. In particular, the following information appears to be dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;View as Document&amp;rdquo; / &amp;ldquo;View as Numbered List&amp;rdquo;: This formatting information doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to get exported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Versions. If you&amp;rsquo;re using the &amp;ldquo;versions&amp;rdquo; feature of Roam, the versions don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be exported either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;implications-of-the-json-format&#34;&gt;Implications of the JSON Format&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Roam allows export of its data in such a simple format, you can easily write scripts for processing this data. For example, merging two databases is trivial. I include some simple such scripts in the following section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clear export also means that you will continue to be able to use your data long into the future, even if Roam shuts down or otherwise becomes unavailable to you. As long as you occasionally back up your data by exporting it, it is yours forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;useful-python-snippets-for-processing-roam-json&#34;&gt;Useful Python Snippets for Processing Roam JSON&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve downloaded your data as JSON from Roam, you can load and manipulate it as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;load-json&#34;&gt;Load JSON&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;import json
filepath = &#39;/path/to/roam-database.json&#39;
data = json.load(open(filepath))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;collect-all-children&#34;&gt;Collect All Children&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;children = []
blocks = data.copy()
while blocks:
  block = blocks.pop()
  if &#39;children&#39; in block:
    blocks.extend(block[&#39;children&#39;])
    children.extend(block[&#39;children&#39;])
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;find-all-notes-mentioning-roam&#34;&gt;Find All Notes Mentioning &amp;ldquo;Roam&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;for child in children:
  if &#39;roam&#39; in child.get(&#39;string&#39;, &#39;&#39;).lower():
    print(child[&#39;string&#39;])
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;merge-two-databases&#34;&gt;Merge Two Databases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since databases are just lists of objects, you can trivially merge them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;merged = db1 + db2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s possible this will result in multiple pages having the same name, but Roam deals with this just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;thank-you-roam&#34;&gt;Thank You Roam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to conclude with a note of thanks to the Roam developers for allowing export in such a clear and readily understandable manner. Doing so inspires confidence that I will be able to continue using the notes I take in Roam far into the future, no matter what. This makes me so much more comfortable using Roam for my note taking. Props and thank you to the Roam developers for this feature.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Date and Time Browser History Queries</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-20-browser-history-date-queries/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-20-browser-history-date-queries/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-11-browser-history-queries/&#34;&gt;number of SQL queries&lt;/a&gt; for browsing my browsing history. In this snippet, I show how to amend them to filter the results by date. Google Chrome selects a slightly non-standard time storage format (microseconds since January 1, 1601 UTC), hence the need for this query stanza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run these queries, first make a copy of your browser history and open it in sqlite3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;cp ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History ~/my-history
sqlite3 ~/my-history
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;google-search-history-for-specific-date&#34;&gt;Google Search History for Specific Date&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the query we had from before, for accessing our Google Search history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;select DISTINCT REPLACE(urls.title, &amp;quot; - Google Search&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;)
from urls
where urls.url like &amp;quot;%www.google.com/search%&amp;quot; 
limit 50;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To filtering by a specific date, we just add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;AND
datetime(last_visit_time / 1000000 + (strftime(&#39;%s&#39;, &#39;1601-01-01&#39;)), &#39;unixepoch&#39;)
LIKE &#39;2019-12-25%&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was I searching for on Christmas last year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;select DISTINCT REPLACE(urls.title, &amp;quot; - Google Search&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;)
from urls
where urls.url like &amp;quot;%www.google.com/search%&amp;quot; 
and datetime(last_visit_time / 1000000 + (strftime(&#39;%s&#39;, &#39;1601-01-01&#39;)), &#39;unixepoch&#39;)
LIKE &#39;2019-12-25%&#39;
limit 50;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;youtube-videos-watched-today&#34;&gt;YouTube Videos Watched Today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To query for results from &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;, we can do the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;select DISTINCT REPLACE(urls.title, &amp;quot; - YouTube&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;), urls.url, datetime(last_visit_time / 1000000 + (strftime(&#39;%s&#39;, &#39;1601-01-01&#39;)), &#39;unixepoch&#39;) as d
from urls
where urls.url like &amp;quot;%www.youtube.com/watch%&amp;quot;
and datetime(last_visit_time / 1000000 + (strftime(&#39;%s&#39;, &#39;1601-01-01&#39;)), &#39;unixepoch&#39;)
LIKE (date(&#39;now&#39;, &#39;localtime&#39;) || &#39;%&#39;)
limit 50;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the use of &lt;code&gt;localtime&lt;/code&gt; to account for the timezone. &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; is used here for string concatenation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;arxiv-papers-visited-last-month&#34;&gt;Arxiv Papers Visited Last Month&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;select DISTINCT urls.title, REPLACE(REPLACE(urls.url, &amp;quot;.pdf&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;), &amp;quot;/pdf/&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;/abs/&amp;quot;)
from urls
where (urls.url like &amp;quot;https://arxiv.org/abs%&amp;quot;
or urls.url like &amp;quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf%&amp;quot;)
and datetime(last_visit_time / 1000000 + (strftime(&#39;%s&#39;, &#39;1601-01-01&#39;)), &#39;unixepoch&#39;)
LIKE (substr(date(&#39;now&#39;, &#39;localtime&#39;, &#39;-1 month&#39;), 0, 9) || &#39;%&#39;)
limit 50;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you can see that &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt; gives flexibility in adjusting the date you are requesting. &lt;code&gt;substr&lt;/code&gt; is used to transform &lt;code&gt;2020-03-20&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;2020-03-&lt;/code&gt;, to match any date in the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hackernews-links-followed-in-the-last-week&#34;&gt;HackerNews Links Followed in the Last Week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;select DISTINCT urls.title, urls.url
from visits
join visits as previous_visits on visits.from_visit == previous_visits.id
join urls on urls.id == visits.url
join urls as previous_urls on previous_urls.id == previous_visits.url
where previous_urls.url like &amp;quot;https://news.ycombinator.com%&amp;quot;
and urls.url not like &amp;quot;https://news.ycombinator.com%&amp;quot;
and datetime(visits.visit_time / 1000000 + (strftime(&#39;%s&#39;, &#39;1601-01-01&#39;)), &#39;unixepoch&#39;)
&amp;gt; date(&#39;now&#39;, &#39;localtime&#39;, &#39;-7 day&#39;)
limit 50;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this query, we directly compare the result of &lt;code&gt;datetime&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html&lt;/a&gt; has more useful information about writing queries manipulating dates and times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more query ideas, here&amp;rsquo;s the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-11-browser-history-queries/&#34;&gt;link back to the browser history queries snippet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Simplifying SQL Queries with &#34;WITH&#34;</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-12-simplifying-sql-with-with/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 Apr 2020 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-12-simplifying-sql-with-with/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-11-browser-history-queries/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;More Browser History Queries&amp;rdquo; snippet&lt;/a&gt; one of the SQL queries I wrote was particularly nasty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to introduce intermediate variables, I had to replicate subqueries multiple times throughout the query. The result was a mess of a query. Using &lt;code&gt;WITH&lt;/code&gt; clauses, the query becomes considerably more readable and maintainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cleaned-up-query&#34;&gt;Cleaned up Query&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the cleaned up query. It selects all the GitHub repos you&amp;rsquo;ve visited from your browser history. To run it, first copy your browser history and open it in sqlite:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;cp ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History ~/my-history
sqlite3 ~/my-history
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, you can run this cleaned up query to see all the GitHub repos that you&amp;rsquo;ve visited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;WITH
data1 as (select LENGTH(&amp;quot;https://github.com/&amp;quot;) as len, * from urls),
data2 as (select SUBSTR(
  url,
  len + 1,
  INSTR(SUBSTR(url, len + 1), &amp;quot;/&amp;quot;) - 1
) as user, * from data1),
data3 as (select SUBSTR(url, len + LENGTH(user) + 2) as rest, * from data2),
data4 as (select SUBSTR(rest, 0, INSTR(rest, &amp;quot;/&amp;quot;)) as repo, * from data3)

select DISTINCT
SUBSTR(url, len + 1, LENGTH(user) + 1 + LENGTH(repo)) as user_repo
from data4
where url like &amp;quot;https://github.com/%&amp;quot;
and LENGTH(repo) &amp;gt; 0
limit 50;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-original-query&#34;&gt;The Original Query&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the original query, with all its messy replicated subqueries, to emphasize just how much using &lt;code&gt;WITH&lt;/code&gt; allowed me to clean this up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;select DISTINCT

-- Selects the user:
-- SUBSTR(
--   urls.url,
--   LENGTH(&amp;quot;https://github.com/&amp;quot;) + 1,

    + 2
  ), 0,
  INSTR(SUBSTR(
    urls.url,
    LENGTH(&amp;quot;https://github.com/&amp;quot;)
    + LENGTH(SUBSTR(urls.url,LENGTH(&amp;quot;https://github.com/&amp;quot;) + 1,INSTR(SUBSTR(urls.url, LENGTH(&amp;quot;https://github.com/&amp;quot;) + 1), &amp;quot;/&amp;quot;) - 1)) -- length(user)
    + 2
  ), &amp;quot;/&amp;quot;)))
  ) -- + LENGTH(repo)
from urls
where urls.url like &amp;quot;https://github.com/%&amp;quot;
and LENGTH(SUBSTR(SUBSTR(
    urls.url,
    LENGTH(&amp;quot;https://github.com/&amp;quot;)
    + LENGTH(SUBSTR(urls.url,LENGTH(&amp;quot;https://github.com/&amp;quot;) + 1,INSTR(SUBSTR(urls.url, LENGTH(&amp;quot;https://github.com/&amp;quot;) + 1), &amp;quot;/&amp;quot;) - 1)) -- length(user)
    + 2
  ), 0,
  INSTR(SUBSTR(
    urls.url,

    + 2
  ), &amp;quot;/&amp;quot;))) &amp;gt; 0  -- LENGTH(repo) &amp;gt; 0
limit 50;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two queries should produce the same results.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Facebook Messenger SQL Queries</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-12-fb-messenger-sql/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-12-fb-messenger-sql/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I dumped all my Facebook messenger messages into a Postgres database. I have it set up so that new messages are added the the database in real time as they are sent. Like I did in a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-11-browser-history-queries&#34;&gt;previous snippet&lt;/a&gt; for analyzing my browsing history, I&amp;rsquo;ll use this snippet to sketch out some useful queries for analyzing my message history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;table-schemas&#34;&gt;Table Schemas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have two tables of messages. &lt;code&gt;messenger_archive&lt;/code&gt; contains all messages from when I first joined Facebook in August 2008 through February 2020. &lt;code&gt;messenger&lt;/code&gt; contains messages from February 2020 through now, and is updated in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the commands &lt;code&gt;\d messenger&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;\d messenger_archive&lt;/code&gt;, I inspect the table schemas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;schema-messenger&#34;&gt;Schema: messenger&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Column&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The message content&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;uid&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A unique message id&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;author&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The &lt;em&gt;fbid&lt;/em&gt; of the message author&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;timestamp&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;number&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The timestamp in milliseconds&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;forwarded&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;boolean&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Whether the message is a forwarded message&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;thread_id&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A unique thread id&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;thread_type&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;GROUP or USER, indicating the thread type&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;schema-messenger_archive&#34;&gt;Schema: messenger_archive&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Column&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;sender_name&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The message author&amp;rsquo;s name&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;timestamp_ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;number&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The timestamp in milliseconds&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;content&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The message content&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;type&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;One of: Payment, Call, Share, Generic, Unsubscribe, or Subscribe&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;title&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The thread title, often the name of the other participant&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;is_still_participant&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;boolean&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Whether I was still in the conversation at the time of the archive (Feb 2020)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;thread_type&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;One of: RegularGroup, Regular&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;thread_path&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A unique identifier for the thread&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;schema-caveats&#34;&gt;Schema Caveats&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;messenger_archive.thread_path&lt;/code&gt; is not the same as the &lt;code&gt;messenger.thread_id&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;messenger.author&lt;/code&gt; is an integer id, whereas the &lt;code&gt;messenger_archive.sender_name&lt;/code&gt; is a string name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There may be a few overlapping messages between the two tables (?), and there may be a few messages not captured in either table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;message-queries&#34;&gt;Message Queries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start sketching some useful queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;finding-links&#34;&gt;Finding Links&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listing domains from the archive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;select distinct
substring(content from &#39;.*://([^/]*)&#39;) as domain
from messenger_archive
limit 1000;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counting unique domains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;select count(*) from (select distinct
substring(content from &#39;.*://([^/]*)&#39;) as domain
from messenger_archive) domains;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listing links from the archive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;select distinct
substring(content from &#39;([a-z]*://[^/\s]*[a-zA-Z/]*)&#39;) as domain
from messenger_archive
limit 1000;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counting unique links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;select count(*) from (select distinct
substring(content from &#39;([a-z]*://[^/\s]*[a-zA-Z/]*)&#39;) as domain
from messenger_archive) foo;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;email-addresses&#34;&gt;Email Addresses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;select distinct
substring(content from &#39;([a-zA-Z0-9.]+@[a-zA-Z0-9]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9]+)&#39;) as email
from messenger_archive
limit 100;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;looking-forward&#34;&gt;Looking Forward&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a number of additional queries I&amp;rsquo;d like to write.
However, they will have to wait until a future snippet.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>More Browser History Queries</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-11-browser-history-queries/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 11 Apr 2020 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-11-browser-history-queries/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-03-19-browsing-history&#34;&gt;Previously&lt;/a&gt; I listed out a few queries for poking at my browser history. Here are some more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As before, I begin by making a copy of my browsing history and opening sqlite3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;cp ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History ~/my-history
sqlite3 ~/my-history
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once that&amp;rsquo;s done, we can start running the queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;youtube-videos-watched&#34;&gt;YouTube Videos Watched&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;select DISTINCT REPLACE(urls.title, &amp;quot; - YouTube&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;), urls.url
from urls
where urls.url like &amp;quot;%www.youtube.com/watch%&amp;quot;
limit 50;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;youtube-search-queries&#34;&gt;YouTube Search Queries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;select DISTINCT REPLACE(urls.title, &amp;quot; - YouTube&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;)
from urls
where urls.url like &amp;quot;%www.youtube.com/results?search_query%&amp;quot;
limit 50;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;google-search-queries&#34;&gt;Google Search Queries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;select DISTINCT REPLACE(urls.title, &amp;quot; - Google Search&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;)
from urls
where urls.url like &amp;quot;%www.google.com/search%&amp;quot; 
limit 50;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;google-maps-usage&#34;&gt;Google Maps Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;select DISTINCT REPLACE(urls.title, &amp;quot; - Google Maps&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;)
from urls
where urls.url like &amp;quot;%www.google.com/maps%&amp;quot; 
and urls.title != &amp;quot;Google Maps&amp;quot;
limit 50;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wikipedia-browsing-history&#34;&gt;Wikipedia Browsing History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;select DISTINCT REPLACE(urls.title, &amp;quot; - Wikipedia&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;)
from urls
where urls.url like &amp;quot;%wikipedia.org/wiki/%&amp;quot;
limit 50;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;github-users-and-orgs&#34;&gt;GitHub Users and Orgs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;select DISTINCT
SUBSTR(
  urls.url,
  LENGTH(&amp;quot;https://github.com/&amp;quot;) + 1,
  INSTR(SUBSTR(urls.url, LENGTH(&amp;quot;https://github.com/&amp;quot;) + 1), &amp;quot;/&amp;quot;) - 1
) as user
from urls
where urls.url like &amp;quot;https://github.com/%&amp;quot;
limit 50;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the GitHub queries ended up being quite messy, so I&amp;rsquo;ve placed them at the end of the document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;arxiv-papers-visited&#34;&gt;Arxiv Papers Visited&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;select DISTINCT urls.title, REPLACE(REPLACE(urls.url, &amp;quot;.pdf&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;), &amp;quot;/pdf/&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;/abs/&amp;quot;)
from urls
where urls.url like &amp;quot;https://arxiv.org/abs%&amp;quot;
or urls.url like &amp;quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf%&amp;quot;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hackernews-comments-read&#34;&gt;HackerNews Comments Read&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;select DISTINCT REPLACE(urls.title, &amp;quot; | Hacker News&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;), urls.url

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-a-different-profile&#34;&gt;Using a Different Profile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to query your search history for a profile other than the default one, you can do so. E.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;cp ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Profile\ 1/History ~/my-history
sqlite3 ~/my-history
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;messy-queries-github-repos-visited&#34;&gt;Messy Queries: GitHub Repos Visited&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This query ended up being quite messy because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to save intermediate results as a variable. So, in order to build the query, I copied and pasted intermediate queries to reuse them. The result, with intermediate queries shown in comments, follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;select DISTINCT

limit 50;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of the queries on this page, you should be able to easily modify them to suit your needs.
I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t try modifying this query, though. It would be much better to build a new query from scratch using using the same technique this one was built with, than to try to modify this one to perform another task, because it would be so easy to modify something in one place but subtly miss modifying it in another location in the query that needs to also be modified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update (April 12, 2020): I&amp;rsquo;ve now learned that you can introduce intermediate &amp;ldquo;variables&amp;rdquo; in your SQL queries, so I&amp;rsquo;ve simplified this query

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a newcomer to OBS, I&amp;rsquo;ve been regularly discovering new features that make my OBS experience better. Here are a handful of things I&amp;rsquo;ve found useful, that perhaps weren&amp;rsquo;t immediately obvious to me, from my early experiences with OBS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-media-sources&#34;&gt;Using Media Sources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Media Source&amp;rdquo; video sources are essential when showing prerecorded video, or using a replay buffer. However, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t obvious to me how to get media sources to play their audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When using a Media Source, here&amp;rsquo;s out to turn on the audio. In the Audio Mixer panel choose &lt;code&gt;Gear Settings &amp;gt; Advanced Audio Properties&lt;/code&gt; then set &lt;code&gt;Audio Monitoring&lt;/code&gt; to &amp;ldquo;Monitor and Output&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;namespaces-for-scenes--turning-off-the-camera&#34;&gt;Namespaces for Scenes + Turning Off the Camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can create multiple Profiles and Scene Collections in OBS. I only have one Profile, which I&amp;rsquo;ve named &amp;ldquo;Default&amp;rdquo; (rather than the default of &amp;ldquo;Untitled&amp;rdquo;). I made a few Scene Collections. Making new Scene Collections gives you a space to play around with new ideas for scenes and keyboard shortcuts, without disrupting the main setup(s) that you&amp;rsquo;ve put together. I like to fiddle around with new ideas in a Scene Collection I&amp;rsquo;ve named &amp;ldquo;Playground&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any sources in a Scene Collection that use your webcam, then your webcam will stay on even when it isn&amp;rsquo;t being used. If you switch to a Scene Collection with no sources using your webcam, then your webcam will turn off. I use a Scene Collection that leaves my webcam off by default, and only switch to a Scene Collection with a webcam source when I actually intend to record something that needs the webcam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;replay-buffer&#34;&gt;Replay Buffer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I leave the replay buffer on in between recording scenes. By setting the replay buffer to a reasonable size like 60 seconds, I can leave it rolling without consuming too much memory (and the CPU consumption has been reasonable too, e.g. 10%). This way, if anything noteworthy happens in this period between recordings, I can still capture it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;virtual-cameras&#34;&gt;Virtual Cameras&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re willing to get your hands dirty, the instructions at 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam&lt;/a&gt; will let you use OBS as a virtual camera on Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;transform-editing-and-scene-json-files&#34;&gt;Transform Editing and Scene &lt;code&gt;.json&lt;/code&gt; files&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cmd-e&lt;/code&gt; opens the Scene Item Transform for a Scene Item. Using that, you can get pixel perfect positioning of any video source. You can also see and edit the json files that describe your scenes. On Mac, these scene json files can be found at &lt;code&gt;~/Library/Application Support/obs-studio/basic/scenes&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;keyboard-shortcuts&#34;&gt;Keyboard Shortcuts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cmd-,&lt;/code&gt; opens your settings. There&amp;rsquo;s a panel for setting keyboard shortcuts. This is a core OBS feature, and it&amp;rsquo;s extremely valuable. I really appreciate how easy OBS has made it to set up these keyboard shortcuts for switching between scenes, starting and stopping recordings, pausing and playing media, etc. I only wish I could have extra modifier keys so I could set up more shortcuts that don&amp;rsquo;t collide with the shortcuts of my IDE!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exploring OBS and Virtual Cameras</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-09-exploring-obs/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-09-exploring-obs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I&amp;rsquo;ve been exploring 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://obsproject.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Open Broadcasting Software&lt;/em&gt; (OBS)&lt;/a&gt; and toying with using it as a virtual camera. I use a Mac, and historically there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been a good way to use OBS as a virtual camera. With 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/tobi&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;@tobi&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s recent 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/2568&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;$10,000 bounty&lt;/a&gt; for making this a core feature, however, some developers in the OBS community leapt into action and a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;working prototype&lt;/a&gt; of the feature was available on GitHub within days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;virtual-cameras&#34;&gt;Virtual Cameras&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OBS is popular software among Twitch streamers. It lets you take a bunch of video sources and rearrange them into scenes. Streamers will often overlay a camera feed of their head and a live stream of a video game, maybe with cool graphics overlaid on the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, OBS has let you take the scenes you create and stream them in real time to YouTube Live or Twitch or any number of other streaming services. If you wanted to use your OBS scene in Zoom or Google Meet, however, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t straightforward, at least on Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were workarounds. You could project your scene to an external monitor, and then use screen sharing to share that. At times there were combinations of tools and plugins that could similarly get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, however, it&amp;rsquo;s considerably easier. John Boiles&amp;rsquo;s has made a OBS plugin that works without fuss. For now it still requires a technical background to use, following build instructions and executing commands on the terminal to get it set up. In a matter of months, however, I expect it will make its way as a core feature into OBS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;combining-obs-with-auto-video-editing&#34;&gt;Combining OBS with Auto Video Editing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may know, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-02-21-jump-cut-programming&#34;&gt;automatic&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-02-26-video-tooling-progress&#34;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-03-02-fastbook&#34;&gt;editing&lt;/a&gt; software. I&amp;rsquo;d like to be able to make quality content &amp;ndash; e.g. videos teaching interesting aspects of programming &amp;ndash; without needing to spend time on the video editing process. The cutting and rearranging would happen automatically. The music and audio adjustments would be added automatically. All I&amp;rsquo;d need to do is write a script and record the footage, and the auto editor would take care of the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally I was using Mac&amp;rsquo;s cmd-shift-5 screen capture capability to create these recordings. OBS lets you rearrange video feeds deliberately and use a variety of video sources. These video sources include window captures, cameras, and prerecorded media. The result is much more flexible than Mac&amp;rsquo;s screen capture, and so I&amp;rsquo;ve switched my auto video editing software over to use OBS for recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, I&amp;rsquo;ve also discovered 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-ndi-newtek-ndi%E2%84%A2-integration-into-obs-studio.528/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;NDI&lt;/a&gt;, a plugin for OBS. It lets me use my phone&amp;rsquo;s camera as a video source with minimal setup. It was so easy to get working, in fact, that I&amp;rsquo;m convinced it must be a large security vulnerability to use it at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;rsquo;m using OBS to record, I enabled my auto video editing software to run automatically on any recording produced by OBS. As soon as the recording gets saved, my software starts editing it automatically (preserving the original). I&amp;rsquo;d love to have my auto editing start even sooner than that though, &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the recording is complete. The OBS codebase is surprisingly approachable, so I may be able to get this working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hacking-on-the-obs-codebase&#34;&gt;Hacking on the OBS Codebase&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When John Boiles released the Mac Virtual Cam plugin for OBS, it was initially stuck on the wrong resolution. John told me it was hard coded to 720x480, and that was the impetus for me to poke at the code. Changing the hard coded resolution proved easy enough. Then I ran into a bug where OBS would fail to capture a window if I changed tabs in that window while OBS was closed. Though there&amp;rsquo;s inertia with entering any unfamiliar codebase, I found I was able to solve this issue for myself too. Through these two debugging experiences I got enough glimpses of the OBS plugin set up to think that OBS really is approachably hackable. I think, with hard work, I could integrate my auto editing code into OBS so that it runs in real time. It&amp;rsquo;s not the very top of my todo list for the auto video editor, but I&amp;rsquo;m excited to give this a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;replay-buffers-in-obs&#34;&gt;Replay Buffers in OBS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One neat feature in OBS is its ability to record a &amp;ldquo;replay buffer&amp;rdquo;. I have it set up to record a circular buffer of the last 60 seconds of content. That means that at any given moment, OBS has recorded the previous 60 seconds of footage. Unsaved footage older than 60 seconds is gone, but at any point, if I choose to save it, I can record the previous 60 seconds of footage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is great because it means I can keep the camera rolling between scenes without wasting memory, and if anything noteworthy happens in that time I can capture it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a second reason I&amp;rsquo;m excited about the replay buffer though; it may enable me to use auto-edited videos in conversations in &lt;em&gt;real time&lt;/em&gt;. I imagine the user experience like this:
I&amp;rsquo;m in a remote meeting and we&amp;rsquo;re having a discussion. By default I&amp;rsquo;m unmuted and people can hear what I&amp;rsquo;m saying. Whenever I hold down a keyboard shortcut, I&amp;rsquo;m muted in the call and OBS starts recording me. When I release the shortcut, I can continue to talk in the call. Once I&amp;rsquo;ve recorded a satisfactory amount of content for OBS, the auto-editing will be applied and I can use OBS as a virtual camera to send that recorded and edited content to my colleagues in the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;looking-forward&#34;&gt;Looking Forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m excited to become more proficient using OBS, and to explore the various plugins and overlays that streamers use with OBS. Particularly I&amp;rsquo;m excited to look into the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/vst-plugins.848/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;audio plugins&lt;/a&gt; that are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also intend to continue my auto-editing plans from before: I&amp;rsquo;m still looking forward to introducing a &amp;ldquo;script&amp;rdquo; with audio auto-transcribed and key events entered via keyboard shortcuts and auto-tracked file saves. And I still want to be able to modify this script to automatically edit the video based on the modifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having explored OBS for a little while now, I&amp;rsquo;m also looking forward to integrating my auto-video editing more closely with OBS, ideally resulting in real time auto editing in the end. Here&amp;rsquo;s to hoping OBS continues to feel approachably hackable!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Understanding OAuth2</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-03-20-understanding-oauth2/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-03-20-understanding-oauth2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://oauth.net/2/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;OAuth2&lt;/a&gt; is confusing. I&amp;rsquo;ve set it up several times before, and each time I encounter it it&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a mental mess to wrap my mind around it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this time, as I set up OAuth2 to let 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/bieber-bot&#34;&gt;Bieber Bot&lt;/a&gt; interact with more Slack workspaces, I will write up my renewed understanding of OAuth2 in the hope that next time I have to set up OAuth2, it&amp;rsquo;s a little easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview-of-the-oauth2-flow&#34;&gt;Overview of the OAuth2 Flow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does the OAuth2 flow go? Like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user wants to add Bieber Bot to a Slack channel. So, they&amp;rsquo;re on my website (
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;davidbieber.com&lt;/a&gt;) and they click the &lt;em&gt;Add to Slack&lt;/em&gt; button. This takes them to Slack, with GET parameters that indicate they want to add Bieber Bot to some Slack workspace. The workspace id can be part of the URL of the Add to Slack button, but even if it&amp;rsquo;s not, Slack will do the right thing and just ask the user to choose one of their workspaces. If the user isn&amp;rsquo;t already logged in to Slack, they&amp;rsquo;ll be prompted to do so at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the user clicks the &lt;em&gt;Add to Slack&lt;/em&gt; button they are taken to Slack, where they are shown the list of OAuth2 scopes that Bieber Bot is requesting. If they approve giving Bieber Bot the permissions listed in the scopes, they are taken to a &lt;em&gt;redirect url&lt;/em&gt; that I, the developer of Bieber Bot, have specified. I have both pre-informed Slack of the redirect URLs I might use, and I have included a specific redirect URL in the link on the &lt;em&gt;Add to Slack&lt;/em&gt; button. When the user is redirected to this redirect url, two GET parameters are included. The first is a &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt;, which my server can use to get an Access Token / Bearer Token. The second is a &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; which is something that I, the developer, can include on the original link from the &lt;em&gt;Add to Slack&lt;/em&gt; button in order to make sure the request I&amp;rsquo;m getting at the redirect URL is genuine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the redirect URL is accessed with a &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; GET parameter, it then turns around and uses that &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; to request an Access Token from Slack. Once it has that Access Token, it tucks it away. It can use that access token in order to perform any of the permissions granted by the user during the access flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually using the Access Token takes the form of issuing post requests to Slack with the Access Token as a parameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user can revoke access to Bieber Bot at any time. Once they do so, the Access Token becomes invalid. If Bieber Bot tries to use the Access Token at that point, it will get an error. The user will have to give Bieber Bot permissions again, and it will get a new access token, in order for it to continue providing its services and companionship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary-of-the-the-important-bits&#34;&gt;Summary of the the Important Bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User navigates from website to service (e.g. via &lt;em&gt;Add to Slack&lt;/em&gt; button).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Service shows user permissions dialog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upon accepting permissions, service redirects user back to website&amp;rsquo;s redirect URL with &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Website uses &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; to get Access Token&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Website uses Access Token to do the stuff allowed by the permissions granted by the user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary-of-the-less-important-bits&#34;&gt;Summary of the Less Important Bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Add to Slack&lt;/em&gt; button should include GET parameters for: a) &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; so the redirect url knows the request is genuine, b) &lt;code&gt;redirect_url&lt;/code&gt; so Slack knows where to send the user after they accept the permissons, c) &lt;code&gt;scope&lt;/code&gt; indicating the permissions being requested, d) &lt;code&gt;client_id&lt;/code&gt; indicating the app (e.g. Bieber Bot) that you&amp;rsquo;re adding to Slack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The permissions that the App can request are set up by the App ahead of time. So I think the &lt;code&gt;scope&lt;/code&gt; parameter is there if you only need to request a subset of that permissions for a particular user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full list of possible redirect URLs should be set up ahead of time. Then when you generate the &lt;em&gt;Add to Slack&lt;/em&gt; button, you just choose a particular redirect URL that Slack should redirect the user to after they accept the permissions. Why would you want more than one redirect URL? Well, one might be for staging, one for production, and one for local development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The redirect URL receives both the &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; GET parameters. The website creating the &lt;em&gt;Add to Slack&lt;/em&gt; button decides on the state. It can then check that the state is there in the redirect URL. This prevents users from going directly to Slack without going through the website, because if they try to do that, they won&amp;rsquo;t have the state and will fail the check at the redirect URL. This is useful if you want to restrict installs for your App to specific customers, e.g. those who&amp;rsquo;ve solved a puzzle, or paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-this&#34;&gt;What is this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This certainly isn&amp;rsquo;t meant to be an OAuth2 guide at all. By writing this out, I think I&amp;rsquo;ve helped myself understand the OAuth2 flow better though. That&amp;rsquo;s really what snippets are all about.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Bit of Browser History Analysis</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-03-19-browsing-history/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-03-19-browsing-history/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2019-12-30-analyzing-my-browser-history&#34;&gt;previous snippet&lt;/a&gt; I started looking into how to analyze my browser history. Revisiting that idea tonight, I began looking into whether I might be able to infer topics of interest from my browsing history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using my previous post as reference, I first made a copy of my browsing history:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;cp ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History ~/my-history
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, using sqlite3 (&lt;code&gt;sqlite3 ~/my-history&lt;/code&gt;) I began poking around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This query allowed me to pull up all my YouTube video views:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;select visits.id, urls.title, urls.url
from visits
join urls on urls.id == visits.url
where urls.url like &amp;quot;%www.youtube.com/w%&amp;quot;
limit 50;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this query gave me my Google Search history:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;select visits.id, urls.title
from visits
join urls on urls.id == visits.url
where urls.url like &amp;quot;%www.google.com/search%&amp;quot; 
limit 50;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one gave me my Wikipedia browsing history:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;select distinct urls.title 
from visits
join urls on urls.id == visits.url
where urls.url like &amp;quot;%wikipedia.org/wiki/%&amp;quot;
limit 50;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it will be useful to bring in the contents of the URLs too, not just the title and url string, for determining topics of interest. Even without that, my Google Search history, YouTube history, and Wikipedia history are already an interesting start.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Principles of Pico</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-03-14-principles-of-pico/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 14 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-03-14-principles-of-pico/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an attempt at capturing and organizing my thoughts on Pico, from our conversation about it March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, an attempt at an overview of the Pico system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You enter cards through a variety of sources. You can enter cards manually, like flash cards. You can also import cards from your note taking software. Cards can also be created from your contacts list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, Pico shows you these cards in an Anki-meets-Tinder swipe-based spaced repetition manner. You get a stack of cards, and each card presents you with a suggested action you should take:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reengage with idea X from your notes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach out to person Y from your contacts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read a passage from book Z&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can choose to perform the action on the card, swiping right. Or you can ignore the card and get the next one on the stack by swiping left. The app automatically learns which cards are good to show you. Ideally it helps you to read more, to reengage with your own ideas over time, and to keep in touch with your friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of things to like about this! I&amp;rsquo;m now going to take a stab at separating out the goals of Pico, the mechanism of Pico, and the specific tasks that Pico targets today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;distilling-the-principles-of-pico&#34;&gt;Distilling the Principles of Pico&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goals are noble. At a high level, Pico aims to help you spend less time on addictive websites with infinite scroll, and more time doing things that matter to you. I applaud anything that sets out to help you reclaim your attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think mentally it helps to separate the mechanism of managing attention that Pico provides from the specific tasks it helps its users to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanism seems to operate around these three principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;offloaded memory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;entropy injection (offloaded decision making)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spaced repetition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specific tasks it helps with are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;brainstorming / reengaging with old ideas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(re)connecting with people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;studying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the mechanism is general enough that other specific tasks can easily be slotted in as cards in the Pico system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;thoughts&#34;&gt;Thoughts!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, stop me if I&amp;rsquo;ve misrepresented Pico so far. Let me tell you what I think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;general-purposeness&#34;&gt;General Purposeness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Pico has some really solid ideas underlying it. Particularly I find the idea of using spaced repetition to reengage with your ideas quite compelling.
The idea of using cards to dive into passages of books is also appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using spaced repetition to reengage with your friends seems a tricky thing to get right, since it risks dehumanizing the relationships without special care taken both by the developer (you) and the user of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these different types of cards seems like it comes with lots of room for domain specific tailoring. For example, if a card represents a passage of a book, the user may want to quickly dive into the full book (not just the passage), and then to create a new card at the end of their reading session so they can continue reading from where they left off later.
If a card represents an idea from my notes, I&amp;rsquo;d like to be able to read the surrounding notes in my note taking software, where I&amp;rsquo;m best able to engage with the ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting each of these domains right in a single app (or through clean interactions with other systems) seems like a difficult challenge, but potentially quite rewarding if done well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;data-entry&#34;&gt;Data Entry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect the usability of Pico will be a big part of what makes the Pico experience pleasant or not. Data entry and the whole card creation process seems like one of the tricky things to get right. If I want to create cards for studying, based on my notes, then I&amp;rsquo;ll want to be taking those notes in some other software (unless you&amp;rsquo;re also building a Roam / RemNote competitor too!). Going from this other software into Pico can be challenging because there are many possible &amp;ldquo;other softwares&amp;rdquo; that people could be coming from and many possible formats people could be taking notes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the book reading case, the experience I would want would be that when I&amp;rsquo;m reading a PDF or eBook a card is automatically created for each book I&amp;rsquo;ve opened, that is automatically kept up to date with the part of the book that I&amp;rsquo;m up to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;overwhelmed-by-cards&#34;&gt;Overwhelmed by Cards&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thought comes from my inexperience with spaced-repetition software systems. It seems like with traditional spaced repetition algorithms, it can be easy to get overwhelmed by a backlog of cards to review if you take a few days (or heavens forbid a week!) off of review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing spaced repetition in Roam Research using an adhoc system I threw together for myself using Browserflow. Instead of having specific days on which to review cards, they get reviewed in a specific review session. If I skip a day, all future review sessions just come a day later; the backlog doesn&amp;rsquo;t grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pico is a method for spending your time with intention. This is fantastic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My understanding of the &amp;ldquo;Principles of Pico&amp;rdquo; are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend less time on things you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be doing (Facebook, Twitter, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend more time on things you do want&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use external mechanisms and automation to guide you toward these good uses of time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use gamification to increase time spent on these productive uses of time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn from experience what works and what doesn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reengage with your own ideas using spaced repetition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reengage with people using spaced repetition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn things via spaced repetition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m 100% on board with these principles and am very excited to see where Pico lands a year from now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heads up that I wrote most of this snippet back on March 14, 2020, and then only finished it up and published it today December 20, 2020. So, forgive the delay and let&amp;rsquo;s continue the conversation some time in the next ten months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fastbook: Listen to Audiobooks Faster</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-03-02-fastbook/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-03-02-fastbook/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Aaron Mayer 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/100audiobooks/the-100-audiobook-challenge-terms-and-conditions-455c7e9409aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;aims to listen to 100 audiobooks in a single month&lt;/a&gt;. He intends to listen to these audiobooks at 2x - 3x speed. Intense!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last few weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-02-21-jump-cut-programming/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;automatic video&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-02-26-video-tooling-progress/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;editing tools&lt;/a&gt;. And one of the core features I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with is 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/carykh/jumpcutter/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;automatic speed adjustments to videos&lt;/a&gt; to eliminate silent airtime and make the videos more engaging. This seems like a perfect fit for Aaron&amp;rsquo;s challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve adapted this tooling into a new tool I&amp;rsquo;m calling 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/dbieber/98f909640773b5b0a0fe5696da369a1b&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Fastbook&lt;/a&gt;. It accepts audiobooks in the form of &lt;code&gt;.wav&lt;/code&gt; files, and can apply speed adjustments to the silence and the spoken word independently, even removing silence entirely if desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Aaron can already comfortably (with great focus) listen to a book at 2.5x speed, he can listen to a 10 hour book in 4 hours. If 20% of that book is actually silence, then the 10 hour book becomes an 8 hour book with silence removed, and the total listen time drops to just 3h12. I think 20% may actually be a conservative estimate for silent time, though it will vary from narrator to narrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimating 45 minutes saved per book, this tool can save over 3 days total time across 100 books. Or, alternatively, Aaron could drop the playback speed down from 2.5x to 2x without increasing his total listening time at all, but potentially helping out his comprehension substantially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tool wont be appropriate for all audiobook listeners. For many, the silences matter, and removing them would degrade the quality of the book. For many, listening at 2.5x would also degrade the quality of the book. So use this tool with caution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who are intersted, however, here&amp;rsquo;s how to use Fastbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-fastbook&#34;&gt;Installing Fastbook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve made Fastbook available for free on GitHub. You can 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/dbieber/98f909640773b5b0a0fe5696da369a1b&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;access it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use it, save it to your computer as &lt;code&gt;fastbook.py&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, make sure you have all the dependencies installed. See the dependencies section for what is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pre-work-converting-your-book-to-wav&#34;&gt;Pre-work: Converting Your Book to &lt;code&gt;.wav&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need your audiobook in wav format to use Fastbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To convert an audiobook to wav, use 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ffmpeg.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install ffmpeg. Then, run &lt;code&gt;ffmpeg -i book.aax book.wav&lt;/code&gt; to convert an Audible audiobook to a wav file. There may be an additional step if your aax file is DRM protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-fastbook&#34;&gt;Using Fastbook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can use Fastbook like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;python fastbook.py \
--audio_path=/path/to/book.wav \
--output_path=/path/to/book-fast.wav \
--loud_speed=1 \
--quiet_speed=5
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;--audio_path&lt;/code&gt; should point to an existing wav file that you downloaded or generated in the pre-work section. &lt;code&gt;--output_path&lt;/code&gt; is the path to the file that Fastbook will generate. Finally, &lt;code&gt;--loud_speed&lt;/code&gt; is how much to speed up the normal spoke text of the book by, and &lt;code&gt;--quiet_speed&lt;/code&gt; is how much to speed up the silence in the book by. You can remove silence by setting &lt;code&gt;--quiet_speed=99999&lt;/code&gt; or any other similiarly large number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dependencies&#34;&gt;Dependencies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the dependencies you need to use Fastbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you need &lt;strong&gt;Python 3&lt;/strong&gt;. You can follow 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://realpython.com/installing-python/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;these instructions&lt;/a&gt; to set up Python 3 if you don&amp;rsquo;t already have it installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, you need these Python depenencies: &lt;em&gt;fire&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;scipy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;tqdm&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;numpy&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;audiotsm&lt;/em&gt;. Install these with &lt;code&gt;pip install fire scipy tqdm numpy audiotsm&lt;/code&gt; or use your favorite Python package manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, to do the pre-work, you will likely need ffmpeg. Installation instructions are available 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ffmpeg.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;read-quick&#34;&gt;Read quick!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend for Aaron to use the default speed settings of &lt;code&gt;--loud_speed=1 --quiet_speed=5&lt;/code&gt;. This wont eliminate the silence entirely, but will reduce the audio time considerably. Then, for the remaining speed-up, I suggest using whatever media player you were already using, such as VLC which supports arbitrary speed adjustments in real time. Hpy rdng!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;demo&#34;&gt;Demo&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>Video Tooling Progress</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-02-26-video-tooling-progress/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-02-26-video-tooling-progress/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last week and a half I&amp;rsquo;ve been making screen recordings of myself programming. Mostly what I&amp;rsquo;ve been programming is tooling to help myself make better screen recordings. Here&amp;rsquo;s an overview of what I&amp;rsquo;ve put together so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;auto-auto-jumpcutter&#34;&gt;Auto Auto-Jumpcutter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This springboards directly from carykh&amp;rsquo;s 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/carykh/jumpcutter&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;jumpcutter&lt;/a&gt; project, which uses 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ffmpeg.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/a&gt; and AudioTSM to speed up the silent sections of a video. Auto Auto-Jumpcutter has two &amp;ldquo;auto&amp;quot;s in its name because jumpcutter already does automatic jumpcutting of videos, and Auto Auto-Jumpcutter uses 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pythonhosted.org/watchdog/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;watchdog&lt;/a&gt; to automatically apply jumpcutter the moment a screen recording is captured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is that my typing appears superhuman in speed, but slows down while I&amp;rsquo;m speaking, without me needing to do any manual editing to the video to achieve this effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;auto-commit&#34;&gt;Auto-Commit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also made for myself a git auto-committer. Every time I save a file during a screen recording session, the change is immediately and automatically committed. The commit message is selected automatically from the diff. The result is that I have a timestamped log of all changes made during the recording. This is super useful for editing the recordings (both automatically and manually) because I can pinpoint exactly where in the recording any change took place. It also works hand-in-hand with the next piece of tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;keyboard-shortcuts&#34;&gt;Keyboard Shortcuts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just using Auto Auto-Jumpcutter goes a long way toward having automatically edited videos, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t completely eliminate the need for manual editing.
For example, it provides no way to do multiple takes and stitch together the good parts of each. For this I&amp;rsquo;ve set up a keyboard shortcut system for myself using the Python 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pypi.org/project/keyboard/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;keyboard&lt;/a&gt; module. This way I can indicate via keyboard shortcuts to remove a selection of footage during the recording session, and have it automatically be removed during the automatic editing phase. This last step &amp;ndash; using the keyboard shortcuts to guide automatic editing &amp;ndash; is an active work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Jump-Cut Programming: Take 1</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-02-21-jump-cut-programming/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-02-21-jump-cut-programming/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been toying around with recording myself programming. Here&amp;rsquo;s a clip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OxsuHWVtMSM&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this clip I use 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/python-fire&#34;&gt;Python Fire&lt;/a&gt; to create a simple two-function calculator. Nothing special about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is special is that the programming has automatically been sped up by 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/carykh/jumpcutter&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;carykh/jumpcutter&lt;/a&gt;, and that I&amp;rsquo;ve used 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;moviepy&lt;/a&gt; to set the programming to the music 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100414&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dangerous&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, a clip I got from 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;YouTube&amp;rsquo;s free Audio Library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-learned-from-take-1&#34;&gt;Lessons Learned from &amp;ldquo;Take 1&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-worked-well&#34;&gt;What worked well?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External Monitor&lt;/strong&gt;: I purchased an external monitor. This made a huge difference. Now I can manage video-editing tools, a terminal, a browser, etc on one screen, while keeping the contents of the video (the editor and public terminal) on the other screen and recording it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/carykh/jumpcutter&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;carykh/jumpcutter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: This tool can automatically speed up the silent parts of a video, resulting in shorter less-boring videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mac Screen Capture&lt;/strong&gt;: cmd-shift-5 lets you capture video on Mac. You can choose what directory the captured video is saved to. Before I discovered this, I used QuickTime, but this is easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pythonhosted.org/watchdog/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;watchdog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; This is a Python module that can monitor your filesystem and trigger an action when files are created or modified. I use it to a) automatically rename video files as they&amp;rsquo;re created, and b) to automatically apply jumpcutting to new captured videos. The filename format I use is &lt;code&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-screen-recording-###.mov&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Python Fire&lt;/strong&gt;: The first twenty clips I recorded (not released) were all of me building the tooling I now use as I record videos. Most of this tooling lives in Python Fire CLIs. These CLIs let me do things like composite audio, perform auto-jumpcutting, and rename videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;things-to-improve&#34;&gt;Things to improve:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zoom in!&lt;/strong&gt; The code is blurry and small and the video as is needs to be watched at 1080p to look OK, which is silly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audio Quality&lt;/strong&gt; I have a lapel mic I&amp;rsquo;m using for new recordings and it helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storytelling&lt;/strong&gt; Is a Python Fire CLI for adding and subtracting the most compelling story? I think there&amp;rsquo;s room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manual Editing&lt;/strong&gt; I did no manual editing for the clip above. I think for quality videos, however, learning to do some manual editing is going to be essential. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how far my inclination to automate everything takes me first though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m really enjoying this process of recording videos. And more than making the videos, I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying building the software to help me make the videos. Next step for me is getting more familiar with moviepy. And Davinci Resolve. But one thing at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Future-Predicting Gameshow Host</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-02-08-future-gameshow-host/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-02-08-future-gameshow-host/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A gameshow host reveals 2 boxes, box A and box B. In box A is either $1 million or 0, in box B there is $1000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re told, choose either just box A or both A and B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You keep the contents of the boxes you choose.
Also, the host knows what box you will choose, and has placed $1 million in A if you will choose only A, and $0 in A if you will choose both A and B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some contestants, faced with this choice, would choose both A and B. They reason that since the money has already been placed, choosing A and B is guaranteed to yield $1000 more than choosing just A.
Others would choose only A, since per the host&amp;rsquo;s plans this option leads to a significantly better payout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly choosing only A is $1000 worse than choosing both A and B, yet choosing A only is allegedly better given the host&amp;rsquo;s foresight. These statements appear contradictory, and this situation is known as 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomb%27s_paradox&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Newcomb&amp;rsquo;s Paradox&lt;/a&gt;.
How can we reconcile these two true but contradictory statements?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do so by clarifying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Right now&lt;/em&gt; choosing only A is $1000 worse than choosing both A and B.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, having a brain&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;em&gt;at the time the money is placed&lt;/em&gt; that will lead you to choose only A at the time of choosing gives the $1 million outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this something you have control over? Can you &lt;em&gt;decide&lt;/em&gt; at the time the money is placed to have a brain that will lead you to later choose only box A?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem like &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;, for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You didn&amp;rsquo;t even know there was a choice to make.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You surely don&amp;rsquo;t get to make choices about how your brain works, right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the host is able know your choice ahead of time, that must mean it&amp;rsquo;s predetermined, right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, none of these reasons are entirely valid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it&amp;rsquo;s true that at the time the money is placed, you didn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily know you had a choice to make. You hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet been informed that you would later be on this gameshow. However, it&amp;rsquo;s possible you considered the situation as a hypothetical anyway (maybe while reading a blog post, for instance). It isn&amp;rsquo;t necessary that you considered precisely the situation that you would later find yourself in, only that you&amp;rsquo;ve given conscious deliberate thought to the way you make choices. By thinking this through, you can decide now whether you have a brain that would later choose box A or one that would later choose both A and B, should the gameshow situation ever arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, you absolutely do get to make choices about how your brain works. You can choose when to sleep, when to study, what substances to ingest, and most importantly, what to focus your attention on. All of these levers are yours to pull, and they all affect how your brain will operate in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time you choose the boxes, it&amp;rsquo;s still your decision as to which box(es) to choose. (In the sense that it&amp;rsquo;s your brain that produces the decision.)
But you must have been predictable, at least to the host, for them to have predicted what choice you would later make.
(Nothing wrong with being predictable!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is it that you were predictable? Does this require determinism?
One extreme way you may have been predictable is if the host knows exactly how events will play out, right down to the thoughts you will have and the choices you will make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; so extreme though. The host only claimed to have roughly one bit of information about you and the future: what binary choice you would make when confronted with the box dilemma. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t require omniscience. The host may have no idea what the weather is going to be the next day, as long as they&amp;rsquo;re able to predict whether or not you&amp;rsquo;re taking box B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So maybe they know a little about how your mind works, or they&amp;rsquo;ve read something you&amp;rsquo;ve posted online that lets them conclude how you will handle the box situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must consider that whatever they know, they knew it at the time that they chose how to fill the boxes. (They likely also knew it at the time they chose to host the gameshow in the first place.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I think is most likely is that this host does know precisely how you think about this choice. They do this by understanding to a very high degree of precision how your brain is going to cope with the decision of which boxes to choose. Think of the host as a very skilled poker player, that can read you like a book. Instead of just knowing whether you&amp;rsquo;re bluffing or not, they know what you&amp;rsquo;re going to think 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6640273&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;before you even think it&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s like weather forecasting, but instead of understanding the atmosphere, they&amp;rsquo;re understanding you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And like with weather forecasting, their model is imperfect. It&amp;rsquo;s good enough to know what box you&amp;rsquo;ll choose, with certainty, but only because that only requires forecasting a small window (a week, let&amp;rsquo;s say) into the future. Like the atmospheric conditions that determine the weather, your brain is a chaotic system. Any imperfection in the model, however small, will eventually blow up and lead to large errors in the model in the future. So our host can&amp;rsquo;t model your every thought a year into the future, let alone e.g. the whole population&amp;rsquo;s behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what boxes should you choose?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should choose to open just box A. By reaching this conclusion (and more importantly, by adopting the strategy for reasoning that leads to this conclusion), you guarantee yourself $1 million the next time you encounter a wealthy generous time travelling gameshow host interested in philosophy and mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What&#39;s Next for Ask Me Anywhere?</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-01-26-next-steps-for-ama/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2020 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-01-26-next-steps-for-ama/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I put up an early version of 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-01-25-ask-me-anywhere/&#34;&gt;Ask Me Anywhere&lt;/a&gt;. You&amp;rsquo;ll notice it&amp;rsquo;s in the snippets section of the website, rather than part of the main blog. This gives me the freedom to post it even though I know it&amp;rsquo;s not as polished as it could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that this first pass is published, it&amp;rsquo;s time to start thinking about where to go next with Ask Me Anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;short-term-stylistic-improvements&#34;&gt;Short Term: Stylistic Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On mobile, the &amp;ldquo;Click to React&amp;rdquo; text shows up and is improperly styled. I didn&amp;rsquo;t intend for it to show up at all. On certain mobile devices and browsers, it seems there are even larger issues than this, such as double tapping sometimes not working at all. Let me know if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work with your browser so I can fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Click to React&amp;rdquo; text also sometimes causes the flow of the text to change, which interrupts the reading experience somewhat. I would like to fix this so that the text flow is never changed by the presence of this message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also would like to tweak the styling to minimize the friction someone feels in deciding to leave a message. I think adding a question-mark icon, which when moused-over gives an explanation of why this feature is there in the first place could be useful. This could strike a good balance between being non-intrusive and letting people know that their thoughts are warmly welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;longer-term-socratic-tutorials&#34;&gt;Longer Term: &amp;ldquo;Socratic Tutorials&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ask Me Anywhere&amp;rdquo; is really an MVP that came out of a larger idea: &amp;ldquo;Socratic Tutorials&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My idea is that a &lt;em&gt;Socratic Tutorial&lt;/em&gt; is a blog post structured in a very particular way. It begins with a brief introduction to a topic, followed by a series of questions you might want to ask about that topic. Click a question to reveal an answer to that question, followed by additional questions you might have about the topic. In this way, you can explore the contents of the post in the order that best suits your interests. I also hope that by having to click questions to view the answers, it will help motivate what you&amp;rsquo;re reading, since you&amp;rsquo;ll be actively wondering about the question when you read the response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a reader of a &lt;em&gt;Socratic Tutorial&lt;/em&gt; doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand something, or has a question that isn&amp;rsquo;t already addressed, they can choose to ask that question. The author can then add it to the list of questions available during reading if they choose to do so. In that way, &amp;ldquo;Ask Me Anywhere&amp;rdquo; is almost a subset of the features planned for Socratic Tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&#34;cbp_example&#34;&gt;
My very first blog post ever was about &lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/post/2012-09-04-collapsible-blog-posts/&#34;&gt;Collapsible Blog Posts&lt;/a&gt;. The premise was that you could click on a paragraph, and it would be replaced with a summary of that paragraph. This paragraph is an example; click on it, and it will be replaced with a summary.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&#34;_cbp_example&#34;&gt;
This was a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/post/2012-09-04-collapsible-blog-posts/&#34;&gt;Collapsible Blog Post&lt;/a&gt; paragraph. Click to un-collapse.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned early on from this experiment that the reverse process actually is more useful. Present the user with a short summary, and let them click if they want to read additional details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&#34;cbp_reverse&#34;&gt;
Here&#39;s an example of a short paragraph that you can click to reveal additional details.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&#34;_cbp_reverse&#34;&gt;
The reason it makes more sense to show the summary first is that it empowers the user to choose how to spend their time. If they are interested in understanding more about a topic, they can choose to expand the paragraph and read the details. If instead they read the extended paragraph first, there isn&#39;t much value to them also reading the summarized version. And if they just want the summarized version, having them see the full version first isn&#39;t too useful either.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways the idea for &amp;ldquo;Socratic Tutorials&amp;rdquo; is a spiritual descendent of Collapsible Blog Posts. They both share a goal: give the user control over the information they&amp;rsquo;re consuming, as they&amp;rsquo;re reading. Socratic Tutorials and Ask Me Anywhere take an additional step though, giving the user the ability to communicate directly with the author while they&amp;rsquo;re reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll likely have noticed that this post uses &amp;ldquo;Ask Me Anywhere&amp;rdquo;. That means you can double click any paragraph, or click between two paragraphs, in order to send a note directly to the author.
I hope you do this, as I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear any thoughts you may have.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-01-25-ask-me-anywhere/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2020 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-01-25-ask-me-anywhere/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With this post, I&amp;rsquo;m demoing a new work-in-progress feature for my blog called &amp;ldquo;Ask Me Anywhere&amp;rdquo;.
The feature lets you leave a comment or ask a question at &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; point while reading my writing.
The goal is to encourage readers to respond to my writing, because I&amp;rsquo;m interested in having a conversation and hearing what you have to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can try it right now. Either &lt;strong&gt;double click&lt;/strong&gt; (double-tap on mobile) on any paragraph, or click between two paragraphs, to open a comment box. Enter your thoughts, click submit, and &lt;em&gt;voila!&lt;/em&gt;, comment submitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re welcome to enter your email address, name, Twitter handle, Facebook ID, or any other form of contact info if you&amp;rsquo;d like me to respond. And if you do, there is high likelihood that I will respond. If you don&amp;rsquo;t, you&amp;rsquo;re anonymous, and you certainly won&amp;rsquo;t receive a private response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments and questions that you submit are not posted publicly anywhere. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a comments section for public discussion. If you want to discuss my posts publicly, submit them on Hacker News or Reddit, or head to Twitter to engage. While this website isn&amp;rsquo;t the place for public discussions, I am curious to know about such a discussion if it&amp;rsquo;s happening. So, feel free to let me know about such a discussion via &amp;ldquo;AMA&amp;rdquo; if you&amp;rsquo;re starting one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens when you leave a comment? This part&amp;rsquo;s still a work in progress, but ideally my digital personal assistant 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/bieber-bot&#34;&gt;Bieber Bot&lt;/a&gt; will notify me of the new comment at the next convenient time. If there are many comments coming in, Bieber Bot will try to be smart about batching the notifications together, and so the notification may be delayed, but I&amp;rsquo;ll soon read your message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, Ask Me Anywhere is only activated for this one post. Once I&amp;rsquo;ve tested it out a bit, and perhaps made some changes, I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to then activate it for the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/posts&#34;&gt;rest of my posts&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets&#34;&gt;and snippets&lt;/a&gt; as well. So I&amp;rsquo;m particularly keen to get feedback early so I can iterate and improve it soon. Give it a try, let me know what you think. You know how to reach me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in learning more about the internals, the source is 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dbieber/davidbieber.com/blob/772b5dd87da532357a1cdf04a8caa027268bfbac/hugo/assets/js-src/ask-me-anywhere.jsx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;available on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. Feel free to have a poke around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name of the project &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Ask Me Anywhere&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; reflects my intention to enable readers to ask questions as they&amp;rsquo;re reading. However, I welcome all types of reactions: questions, comments, feedback, corrections, new ideas, etc. I look forward to hearing what you have to say.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How much time has humanity spent on different areas of science?</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-01-24-time-spent-on-science/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-01-24-time-spent-on-science/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;How much time has humanity, collectively, spent researching physics?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about chemistry? Neuroscience? Algorithms? (etc&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How has this rate of study changed over time?
How much of it is duplicate work (e.g. two nations or organizations independently working toward the same milestones before sharing their findings)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What fraction of this is done by professors, post docs, PhD students, etc?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particularly in the last 100 years, what have these numbers been?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m interested in visualizing some of these metrics, because I think they would be useful for putting the work that I see happening around me in machine learning and in neuroscience into perspective. I also think this data would tell a fascinating story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, one plot that I think would be compelling would be person-hours-per-year spent thinking about physics plotted as a function of time over the last 100 years, with important physics milestones shown on the same plot (e.g. as a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/berkeleyischool/how-to-create-a-visualization-showing-events-on-time-series-data-in-excel-96abbc1475e0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;time series plot with events&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One worry with such a visualization is that the population is growing rapidly, and so the interesting story of how humanity&amp;rsquo;s attention has shifted between fields over time may be lost to a visualization that simply shows population growth. It may be necessary to normalize by population to tell such a story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem infeasible to precisely collect this data, as there is no public registry of who is thinking about what. However, I think the data is perhaps more readily available than appears at first blush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where would the data come from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search trends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;University enrollments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publication counts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surveys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search trends are of course a more recent source of data, only going back one or two decades. The pre-1990s version of search trends might be library records, or book sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;University enrollments and degrees granted tells a significant story about how many people are studying different areas. You can roughly estimate how much time a student majoring in physics puts into their studies, and if course enrollments are available that estimate can be even more precise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific fields make their mark on the world by publishing their research. Counting publications can provide an estimate of one piece of humanity&amp;rsquo;s effort studying science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, for contemporary data, and maybe even a little historical data, one could uses surveys / polling techniques to estimate where scientific mindshare is going today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among this data I&amp;rsquo;d be curious to see when historically there have been large swings in mindshare toward a particular topic. Right now, anecdotally, machine learning research is engaging a quickly increasing number of people, including drawing people away from other fields. I&amp;rsquo;d love to see this anecdotal evidence backed up (or refuted) by data. And I expect there are plenty of similar historical precidents that I would be quite interested in learning more about as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t forsee collecting this data or performing these visualizations myself in the near future. This post is just an opportunity to think aloud, not a plan for my own action. But if you have data like this, or know of someone who has done a related analysis, I&amp;rsquo;d be quite interested to hear about it. Don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Say One Thing Well</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-01-14-say-one-thing-well/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-01-14-say-one-thing-well/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Blog posts written by amateurs are often interesting and entertaining; they can offer perspectives not seen elsewhere. However, they often fall into the trap of trying to do too much. The best blog posts do one thing, and do it well. If you&amp;rsquo;re writing a blog post, you should choose a single, narrow point that you want to make, and make it well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this may seem like obviously good advice, in practice the temptation to broaden the scope of a blog post can be very real. So it is important to actively practice discretion in limiting the scope of any post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does scope creep come about? Authors may have a temptation to write about tangentially related topics. Sometimes this will be in order to provide justification or context. Other times the author simply has multiple lessons on the same topic they wish to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any one of these scenarios will lead the author to increase the scope of their writing. Even in the face of these situations, however, it is important to keep a narrow scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, for example, the core message is that &amp;ldquo;when writing a blog post, you should have a narrowly scoped thesis.&amp;rdquo; It is tempting for me to then also write about how to choose that thesis. After all, this seems a natural discussion to have while explaining the importance of a narrow scope. However, this would be a dangerous move, because a good discussion about how to choose a thesis well requires giving advice like &amp;ldquo;ask yourself: what are you interested in and knowledgeable about?&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;think about what your audience is likely to care about&amp;rdquo;, etc. These suggestions don&amp;rsquo;t help make the core point, that your scope should be exceedingly narrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In writing this post, it is tempting to write about how &amp;ldquo;trying to do too much can lead to doing multiple things poorly&amp;rdquo; applies in other, non-writing, contexts too. This has the potential to be an insightful discussion. However, this would only serve to detract from the main point: in &lt;em&gt;writing blog posts specifically&lt;/em&gt;, you should choose a single main point and make it well. Trying to broaden this to other contexts would weaken the argument, because the wider the context is, the more exceptions there are. If I had said &amp;ldquo;in all of life, do one thing and do it well&amp;rdquo;, people would correctly protest: that&amp;rsquo;s no way to live a life, you should aim to be well-rounded. So, I strengthen my argument by narrowing its scope: in writing a blog post, pick a single thesis and defend it convincingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it important to have just one main point? To start, having a single well defined main point improves the clarity of your writing. It is easier to be persuasive when you have a well-defined objective you are trying to impress upon your readers. Stray too far from this main point and it distracts the reader and weakens your piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the age of online writing and sharing, the importance of a single clear thesis is increased. Having a well-scoped piece increases its sharability. There is no risk that the recipient of the shared article will mistake the reason for its sharing. Having a well-scoped piece also makes it easier to reference that piece in the future. One can simply link to the article if they want to leverage its argument, rather than needing to specify &amp;ldquo;in the third section of David&amp;rsquo;s piece on online writing&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally readers have limited time and attention. So, don&amp;rsquo;t bury the lead. Don&amp;rsquo;t make readers have to dig deep to uncover a point that can be stated succinctly. Show your readers your respect for their time and attention by making your point immediately clear. Then they can make an informed choice about whether they&amp;rsquo;d like to learn more. It&amp;rsquo;s their time. Don&amp;rsquo;t trick them with ambiguous or click-bait headlines. Let them invest it well by telling them upfront what it is you want to convince them of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course there are exceptions to the rule. For educational pieces, teaching a curriculum of topics, it may be appropriate to have multiple lessons. And if you&amp;rsquo;re writing for literary value, then the core takeaway may not be the central reason for your writing. In the general case though, critical for the vast majority of blogs being written today, it is wise to stick to a single thesis. State it clearly and defend it well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve learned just one thing from this article, it&amp;rsquo;s that the best articles should leave you with just one thing to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Writing Assistant Tool Idea</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-01-13-writing-tool-idea/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-01-13-writing-tool-idea/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;background-writing-is-hard&#34;&gt;Background: Writing is Hard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I find writing feels easy &amp;ndash; e.g. when 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2019-12-30-writing-for-no-audience/&#34;&gt;writing for no audience&lt;/a&gt;, when writing something you&amp;rsquo;ve already thought extensively about, when telling a story in a logical order that you&amp;rsquo;re deeply familiar with. Other times, I find writing very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;rsquo;m writing a paper, I am writing explicitly for an audience, the story is not always clear immediately, and the material is something I&amp;rsquo;m becoming familiar with over time, not something about which I&amp;rsquo;m already deeply familiar.
So, I find paper writing hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have an idea that I think will help me write more effectively. It&amp;rsquo;s a software tool that structures the time you spend writing. I&amp;rsquo;ll describe the tool, but I don&amp;rsquo;t anticipate building it. Perhaps we can come up with a low-resource version of this idea, e.g. with paper and pencil, that I can try even without building this tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-writing-system&#34;&gt;The Writing System&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool presents you with a prompt, a textbox, and a timer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial prompt is &amp;ldquo;What do you want to write about?&amp;rdquo;, and the initial timer is for 5 minutes. Subsequent prompts will be determined from what you&amp;rsquo;ve entered in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the textbox, you are encouraged to respond to the prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of your response, you can issue some commands / keywords.
If you start a line with &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;, then that line will get used as a future prompt.
You can specify the relative importance of a future prompt by including a priority.
This will determine the order in which you are presented with the prompts.
E.g. &lt;code&gt;!0&lt;/code&gt; is highest priority, and so such a line will become the next prompt you receive, unless there are other priority 0 prompts already queued up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;! &amp;lt;topic&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is short for &amp;ldquo;&amp;lt;topic&amp;gt; is a topic I want to write about later&amp;rdquo;
&lt;code&gt;? &amp;lt;question&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is short for &amp;ldquo;&amp;lt;question&amp;gt; is a question I want to answer later&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There should also be a way to indicate &amp;ldquo;&amp;lt;topic&amp;gt; is a topic I&amp;rsquo;ll need to do more research on&amp;rdquo;, and then for one of the prompts to be about spending time researching a topic, rather than writing about it. Then the next prompt may be to write about what you just learned in the research section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other available commands include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;:pause&lt;/code&gt; to stop the timer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;:unpause&lt;/code&gt; to start the timer again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;:extend&lt;/code&gt; to add additional time to the timer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;:next&lt;/code&gt; to skip to the next prompt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system is easily extensible, so a writer with a programming background can easily add new commands, or modify the logic that determines when prompts are shown and when breaks are taken. A programming-proficient writer will also have programmatic access to everything they write, as well as the corresponding prompts and metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the timer reaches 0, a short break is initiated, and then the next prompt is revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is to move quickly, and get all your thoughts onto the page, without getting bogged down in a DFS traversal of information about a single line of the overall text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;additional-details&#34;&gt;Additional details&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every keystroke is logged, so if you write something, and then switch to a new version of it, you will still be able to see the original version. No need to worry about pasting in a password though, since the keylogging data is readily accessible in a plaintext format and you can edit it directly e.g. if anything sensitive does leak in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This system has a decent amount of overlap with the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/shh-shell&#34;&gt;shh shell&lt;/a&gt; project that I&amp;rsquo;ve already built,
and perhaps a version of this new idea could be easily added to the shh shell. Alternatively, the shh-shell could be forked to build this new system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calendar integration would be cool, so that it times your prompts nicely if you have a meeting coming up so you get to a good break point in time for your meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;implementation-thoughts&#34;&gt;Implementation Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to build this onto an existing text editor, rather than writing my own. E.g. using Google Docs would be good.
However, the disadvantage of this is that it makes the keystroke logging feature more difficult. Fortunately, Google Docs does have good history tracking. Google Docs also provides good programmatic access. So, an agent running in the background while you write could be taking periodic snapshots too. Such an agent could also be extracting the commands and prompts you write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to execute the commands immediately, the way shh shell does. For some commands this may be a real disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also like the idea of the agent giving the prompts being Bieber Bot &amp;ndash; that is, being the same &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; as my personal digital assistant. I can picture it asking me &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;ve been writing continuously for over an hour; is it time for a break?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;it looks like you stopped writing abruptly there, did you get distracted?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;initial-experimentation&#34;&gt;Initial Experimentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying the idea out in a low-tech way (manually timing things, manually looking up what the next prompt should be).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the main issue I&amp;rsquo;ve seen so far in the first half hour of testing. When the time runs out for a prompt, I&amp;rsquo;m still in the middle of the prompt. I&amp;rsquo;ve usually started expounding on some idea relevant to the prompt, and there are actually several ideas remaining that I haven&amp;rsquo;t even started exploring for the prompt yet. So what should have happened / what should I do next time? Maybe I could have done a higher level discussion of the prompt and made new future sub-prompts along the way. Or at the end of a section, I could have the system give me a bit of time to create sub-prompts of things I&amp;rsquo;d like to address in the section but didn&amp;rsquo;t get to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could see having a limited time to create new prompts be a good forcing function for coming up with structured high level thinking after a moderate amount of time of lower level writing. So in my next round of testing, I&amp;rsquo;ll try this, and continue to iterate on the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learning by Teaching in Online Education</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-01-09-learning-by-teaching/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-01-09-learning-by-teaching/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Long ago (2013) I spent a summer interning at Khan Academy.
Also long ago (2014) 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/harvest_zhang&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Harvest&lt;/a&gt; and I built a tool for creating educational videos online, in the browser (
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/teach-everyone&#34;&gt;Teach Everyone&lt;/a&gt;; warning, bit rot ahead).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I want to see these two methodologies combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want it to become common practice that after you spend significant time learning something online, you make a quick-and-dirty video explaining what you just learned.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-vision&#34;&gt;The Vision&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you&amp;rsquo;ve just completed a series of organic chemistry lessons on Khan Academy. The KA website pops up a modal recommending that you &amp;ldquo;Make a video teaching what you learned to help solidify your understanding of Organic Chemistry!&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You click through to a browser based video creation tool &amp;ndash; a cross between Google Slides, Illustrator / Teach Everyone, and OBS / a video editor.
In minutes, you&amp;rsquo;re able to assemble a video teaching the material you&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last hours or days wrapping your head around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You combine text, images, drawings, video, and audio to create your video. And when you&amp;rsquo;re done, you have the option to save it privately, share it on YouTube or social media, or to make it visible to others studying the same subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;benefits&#34;&gt;Benefits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main benefits from this approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You get to learn by teaching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teaching is a super effective way to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reinforce the material so that you remember it longer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help you notice gaps in your understanding and fill them in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So by preparing this little video after spending all that time learning, you&amp;rsquo;ll be left with a better and longer lasting understanding of the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Others can learn from &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often times the best teachers are those who remember what it&amp;rsquo;s like not to understand. Since you&amp;rsquo;ve just gone through the process of learning the material, you know exactly which parts were difficult to grasp and what it took for you to grasp them. So your video may end up helping others more than the KA videos in some cases!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;video-creation-tool&#34;&gt;Video Creation Tool&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post isn&amp;rsquo;t a design doc, but I will briefly sketch out what I imagine for the video creation tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main interface is a video preview above a timeline, similar to what you would see in Davinci Resolve or any professional video editing tool. You additionally have the option to create clips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can create clips from text, images, KA-style drawings, audio, or video. Importantly, you can record audio and video clips, or create a KA-style drawing, directly in your browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve created some clips, you can position them both in time (on the timeline), and in space (on the video preview).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I intend to write more about the details of this vision for video creation tool at a later point, but for now the most important thing about it is that it prioritizes being quick to use over being fully featured and professional, and that it can be used directly in the browser. This way it can be used by online learners as part of their online learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;additional-notes&#34;&gt;Additional Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main premise is that students, young and old, should have a light-weight way to create educational videos immediately after learning something online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve framed this discussion around a hypothetical tool for students to use on Khan Academy, but it applies equally well to educational videos on YouTube and elsewhere. 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/teach-everyone&#34;&gt;Teach Everyone&lt;/a&gt; was an early prototype showing that you can create Khan Academy style animated drawings (i.e. virtual writing on a blackboard) with accompanying audio directly in the browser. Since then, Teach Everyone has suffered some bit rot and unfortunately isn&amp;rsquo;t operational today. However, I&amp;rsquo;m hopeful that some new project will step up, and provide an even better in-browser experience for educational video creation. And then beyond that, I&amp;rsquo;m hopeful that this tool becomes common place for students to use as part of their everyday online learning routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to discuss these ideas, don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to get in touch: &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:david810+learning-by-teaching@gmail.com&#34;&gt;david810+learning-by-teaching@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What does &#34;Ordinary&#34; mean in Ordinary Least Squares?</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-01-08-ordinary-least-squares/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2020 02:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-01-08-ordinary-least-squares/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ordinary Least Squares&amp;rdquo; regression, or OLS for short, is a method for finding a best-fit line, given a set of data points. When people refer to linear regression without additional context or qualifiers, they&amp;rsquo;re probably referring to ordinary least squares regression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what does &amp;ldquo;ordinary&amp;rdquo; mean in this context? Is it a mathematical term with a precise technical meaning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, no. In this case &amp;ldquo;ordinary&amp;rdquo; means exactly what you might expect: standard, vanilla, lacking any bells and whistles. Since least squares regression is so common, there are lots of variants. Weighted Least Squares (in which each data point is given its own weight) is a such a variant. So, in OLS, the O for ordinary simply means we&amp;rsquo;re not referring to one of these variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about &amp;ldquo;ordinary differential equations&amp;rdquo; (ODEs)? What does ordinary refer to there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that context, ordinary refers to ordinary derivatives, as opposed to partial derivatives. So again, it&amp;rsquo;s not a mathematical term like a reference to ordinal numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both cases, ordinary seems to take on its ordinary English definition &amp;ndash; its OED, if I may.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-01-02-pyd-swyt-cf-bh-din/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 02:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-01-02-pyd-swyt-cf-bh-din/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;pyd-swyt-cf-bh-din&#34;&gt;pyd-swyt; cf-bh-din&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s pronounced just like it&amp;rsquo;s spelled (&amp;ldquo;pied, swite, cuff, buh-din&amp;rdquo;). It&amp;rsquo;s my life motto.
And I think these are good principles to live by. Here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pursue your dreams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Say what you think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cultivate friendships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be happy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do it now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think each of these is self-explanatory. Briefly though, let&amp;rsquo;s consider each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pursue-your-dreams&#34;&gt;Pursue Your Dreams&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work toward long term goals you think are worthwhile.
It&amp;rsquo;s easy to fall into the trap of chasing promotions and paychecks, so the &amp;ldquo;pyd&amp;rdquo; in pyd-swyt serves as a reminder to never lose sight of your dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;say-what-you-think&#34;&gt;Say What You Think&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be easier to go along with the status quo than to voice dissent.
It can be easier to assume others are correct than to voice confusion.
Usually though, it is better to express your dissent / confusion / support.
The &amp;ldquo;swyt&amp;rdquo; in pyd-swyt serves as a constant reminder to speak your mind, especially when it would be more comfortable not to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cultivate-friendships&#34;&gt;Cultivate Friendships&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reach out to people you care about, and to people you want to know better.
Reconnect with those you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen in a long time, rather than losing touch with them gradually.
Time spent with friends is time well-spent, so the &amp;ldquo;cf&amp;rdquo; in &amp;ldquo;cf-bh-din&amp;rdquo; stands as a reminder to cultivate friendships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;be-happy&#34;&gt;Be Happy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do the things you love, and do them often.
Spend time with the people you care about.
Do what makes you happy.
Don&amp;rsquo;t sacrifice these things for your other values.
&amp;ldquo;bh&amp;rdquo;; be happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-it-now&#34;&gt;Do It Now&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are principles for now.
Don&amp;rsquo;t wait to pursue your dreams.
Don&amp;rsquo;t wait to say what you think.
Don&amp;rsquo;t wait to cultivate friendships.
Certainly don&amp;rsquo;t wait to be happy.
Do each of these things every day, starting now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What To Do in Moments of Internet Addiction</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-01-02-moments-of-internet-addiction/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-01-02-moments-of-internet-addiction/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I often feel addicted to YouTube, TV shows, browsing HackerNews, or social media.
When I do, I&amp;rsquo;m tempted to just keep scrolling or watching, and I can waste hours on the internet.
Afterward, and even during, I may feel an inclination to stop, but I continue consuming content anyway.
It feels unhealthy, and I generally regret when I spend my time this way.
For some reason, I do it anyway though, and so I think of this habit like an addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re like me and fall into these unhealthy attention-consuming rabbit holes, here is a list of things we can do instead of continuing the addictive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing; doing &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; is a perfectly valid option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Say hi to a friend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go for a walk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read a book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monologue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make plans for the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluate HALT (hungry? angry? lonely? tired?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluate 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-01-02-pyd-swyt-cf-bh-din&#34;&gt;pyd-swyt; cf-bh-din&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2019-12-30-analyzing-my-browser-history&#34;&gt;toying with&lt;/a&gt; the idea of getting Bieber Bot to notice when I&amp;rsquo;m exhibiting addictive behavior. If I can get that working, I&amp;rsquo;d love for Bieber Bot to notice when I&amp;rsquo;m addicted to YouTube, Hacker News, or Twitter and suggest one of the above activities for me to perform instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The missing entries I don&amp;rsquo;t recall or have readily available, but I had goals in those years too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, I add a new resolution to the table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Year&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Resolution&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Status&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Result&lt;/th&gt;

      <title>Writing for No Audience</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2019-12-30-writing-for-no-audience/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Dec 2019 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2019-12-30-writing-for-no-audience/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started this 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;snippets&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; section of my website just a few days ago with the intention of being able to write without needing to put polish on a piece before publishing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thinking was that I would be able to put small notes there, and half-baked ideas, and not have to worry about diluting the quality of the content of my 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/posts&#34;&gt;main website&lt;/a&gt;. I could put high quality posts on the main site, and a whole range of both good and bad posts in the snippets section. This way, assuming I do a good job, readers could come to expect that any post on the main website would be high quality. Curious people looking for additional content could come here to the snippets section if they wanted to, but more often posts here would either (1) almost never get read, or (2) be linked to directly, e.g. if they were relevent in some other context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been surprised and delighted by the effect that having this &amp;ldquo;No Audience&amp;rdquo; section of the website has had on my writing. Writing for no one is so much easier than writing for someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a few occasions (and it&amp;rsquo;s only been a few days since I started this section), I&amp;rsquo;ve started writing snippets intending for them to be brief thoughts meant for no one but myself. Then, after starting, it has felt natural to expand the post into something more substantial than I originally intended, e.g. answering questions that a hypothetical reader might have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/post/2019-12-29-track-your-life-in-a-spreadsheet&#34;&gt;occasion&lt;/a&gt; I even decided to bump the post up in importance after getting started, placing it in the main section of the website rather than relegating it to the mostly hidden snippets section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To anyone out there who does end up reading this, and there may very well be none of you: if you&amp;rsquo;re having trouble getting started with writing, write for no audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-different-degrees-of-no-audience&#34;&gt;The Different Degrees of &amp;ldquo;No Audience&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually write for No Audience in two different contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) The 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets&#34;&gt;snippets&lt;/a&gt; section of my website&lt;br&gt;
(2) Using 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/shh-shell&#34;&gt;shh-shell&lt;/a&gt; at night&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The snippets section of my website is public, but with no built-in broadcasting. People can read it if they choose to, but I&amp;rsquo;m not putting it in people&amp;rsquo;s faces (by default; I will if it&amp;rsquo;s appropriate in context). Contrast this with the writing I do with the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/shh-shell&#34;&gt;shh-shell&lt;/a&gt;. This is more personal writing that I do half-asleep as I drift off at night, and so I don&amp;rsquo;t make it public; I expect almost no one will ever read it. This writing, I suppose is for No Audience to an even more extreme degree. I recommend both practices: public writing for no audience, and private writing for no audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;social-media-doesnt-cut-it&#34;&gt;Social Media Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Cut It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered this practice and am quite fond of it, I think it could be a promising addition to social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No social media platform, to my knowledge, has given people a place to write public posts with an option to publish but not share them. The absense of such a feature makes sense; social media platforms need you to share for them to succeed, so how would giving you a space to publish-but-not-share help them? The answer lies in the psychology of the many social-media lurkers. There is a significant market segment of people who perhaps consume, but do not post, on social media. An option to publish-but-not-broadcast might help to convert some of that segment into sharers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a social media consumer, but infrequent producer, I can tell you I am hesitant even to Like something on Twitter, because I know Twitter often treats Likes like Retweets, and will put the content I hearted in front of my followers with my name attached, and that&amp;rsquo;s not something I want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a feature for publishing-without-sharing were added to Facebook or Twitter, perhaps others would have an experience like mine over the last few days. Having the option to publish-but-not-share has significantly reduced the barrier to start writing for me. Then, once I&amp;rsquo;ve started writing, I&amp;rsquo;ve often changed my mind and decided I want to share what I&amp;rsquo;ve written after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If other social-media lurkers are like me, a feature enabling this behavior could help &amp;ldquo;break the ice&amp;rdquo; so to speak, and could make social media platforms more relevant to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;next-steps&#34;&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to continue building this snippets section for myself, with the default behavior being no-broadcasting as I add snippets. For snippets I&amp;rsquo;m fond of, I may choose to broadcast (e.g. by posting about the post on social media). Contrast this with the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/posts&#34;&gt;main posts section&lt;/a&gt; of my website; for new posts there, I will generally always broadcast the post, at least a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;d like to receive such broadcasts, e.g. when I write a post that I&amp;rsquo;m particularly keen on sharing, please consider subscribing:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Planning to Analyze My Browsing History</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2019-12-30-analyzing-my-browser-history/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2019-12-30-analyzing-my-browser-history/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve learned recently that programmatically accessing your browsing history is rather straightforward. Really exciting! This is rich data, from which I think I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to learn a lot and hopefully combat unwanted distractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First let me describe what information is available, and how you can access it. Then, let&amp;rsquo;s discuss what you can do with this data. As I&amp;rsquo;ve written about previously 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/bieber-bot/&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/post/2019-12-29-track-your-life-in-a-spreadsheet/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;, I already have a chat bot system in place, which will be able to take advantage of this data to e.g. help me stay focused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;accessing-your-browser-history&#34;&gt;Accessing Your Browser History&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to GitHub user 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dropmeaword&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;dropmeaword&lt;/a&gt; for compiling 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/dropmeaword/9372cbeb29e8390521c2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this gist&lt;/a&gt; explaining how to access your browser history via sqlite3. The gist covers Safari, Chrome, and Firefox. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll just focus on Chrome on OSX, since that&amp;rsquo;s my primary mode of browsing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Chrome browsing history is located at &lt;code&gt;~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History&lt;/code&gt;. Since I use multiple profiles in Chrome, each profile gets its own browsing history, e.g. located at &lt;code&gt;~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Profile 1/History&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each browsing history is stored as a sqlite3 database. Before analyzing the data, I recommend making a copy of it (&lt;code&gt;cp ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History my-history&lt;/code&gt;); this way your history database (a) wont be locked by Chrome while you&amp;rsquo;re trying to access it, and (b) wont change while you&amp;rsquo;re looking at it, which could cause confusion and inconsistencies in your results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means you can browse it interactively using the sqlite3 REPL by running &lt;code&gt;sqlite3 PATH_TO_DATABASE&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also libraries available for accessing sqlite3 databases in just about every language. For Python, there&amp;rsquo;s the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;sqlite3&lt;/a&gt; library. Go has 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://godoc.org/github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;go-sqlite3&lt;/a&gt;. JavaScript has 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-nodejs/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this sqlite3 module&lt;/a&gt;. However you most like scripting, you&amp;rsquo;ll have a familiar way of accessing the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-available-data&#34;&gt;The Available Data&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running sqlite3 macro &lt;code&gt;.tables&lt;/code&gt;, we see the following tables are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;downloads&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;meta&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;urls&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;downloads_slices&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;segment_usage&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;visit_source&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;downloads_url_chains&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;segments&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;visits&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;keyword_search_terms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;typed_url_sync_metadata&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll be most interested in the &lt;code&gt;urls&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;visits&lt;/code&gt; tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;urls&lt;/code&gt; table has these columns (found with &lt;code&gt;.schema urls&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Column&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;id&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Integer Id&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; of the URL in the database.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;url&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The URL of the website.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;title&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The title of website.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;visit_count&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Integer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The number of times you&amp;rsquo;ve visited the URL.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;typed_count&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Integer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The number of times you&amp;rsquo;ve visited the URL by typing in the address (as opposed to by following a link.)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;last_visit_time&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Integer (microseconds since the epoch)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The time of the most recent to the URL.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;hidden&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Boolean&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what this is about.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the &lt;code&gt;visits&lt;/code&gt; table has these columns (obtained via &lt;code&gt;.schema visits&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Column&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;id&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Integer Id&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; of the visit in the database.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;url&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Integer Id&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; of the url in the &lt;code&gt;urls&lt;/code&gt; table.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;visit_time&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Integer (milliseconds since the epoch)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The time of the visit.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;from_visit&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Integer Id&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; of the visit that lead you to this one.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;transition&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Bit vector&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Represents the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/history#transition_types&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;transition type&lt;/a&gt; (how you got to the URL)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;segment_id&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Integer Id&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; of the segment in the database. I&amp;rsquo;m not quite sure what a segment is, but there is a &lt;code&gt;segments&lt;/code&gt; table you can look at.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;visit_duration&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Integer (microseconds)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The amount of time spent at the website, or 0 if not available.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;incremented_omnibox_typed_score&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Boolean&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I do not know what this is about.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we can access every visit to every website that we&amp;rsquo;ve made since the last time we cleared our browsing history. We can see what website we visited (&lt;code&gt;visits.url&lt;/code&gt;), when we visited it (&lt;code&gt;visits.visit_time&lt;/code&gt;), how many times we&amp;rsquo;ve visited it (&lt;code&gt;urls.visit_count&lt;/code&gt;), and how long each visit was for (&lt;code&gt;visits.visit_duration&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can even use &lt;code&gt;visits.from_visit&lt;/code&gt; to figure out what website linked us to each url, if that interests us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-can-we-deduce&#34;&gt;What Can We Deduce?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can (1) perform a historical analysis on the data, as well as (2) do real-time monitoring of the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I brainstorm some of the historical trends we will be able to uncover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most frequently visited websites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Websites where we spend the majority of our time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Websites that frequently lead to known-distractor websites (e.g. Reddit, Hacker News, Twitter, YouTube)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can do an analysis by time of day (or day of week), to figure out what sites occupy my time late at night vs during daylight hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are somewhat interesting, but what I&amp;rsquo;m particularly excited for is the ongoing analysis that 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/bieber-bot&#34;&gt;Bieber Bot&lt;/a&gt; can provide by accessing the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a brainstorm of the more real-time actionable insights we might extract from this data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bieber Bot could ping me if it looks like I&amp;rsquo;m spending too much time on a distraction website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He could try to detect if I went to a website with a particular purpose, but ended up getting distracted and not completing the purpose I set out to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if I&amp;rsquo;m on a productive website and then switch to a distraction website for more than a few minutes, particularly during work hours, Bieber Bot might message asking if I got distracted. Think you could do that for me Bieber Bot?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I could signal that I want to view a website later by opening it and immediately closing it again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps we could detect if I&amp;rsquo;m researching a particular topic, and then Bieber Bot could try to help me with my research.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;related-idea&#34;&gt;Related Idea&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to reduce distractions, I&amp;rsquo;d like to be able to switch my browsing mode from &amp;ldquo;clicking opens links&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;clicking saves a link for later&amp;rdquo;. When in this new mode, whenever I click a link it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t open that link; instead, it would save the link to a list of deferred links.
Then I would be able to view my &amp;ldquo;saved for later&amp;rdquo; links when I have time that I&amp;rsquo;ve explicitly set aside, rather than during the time that I would rather be doing something more productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;next-steps&#34;&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far I&amp;rsquo;ve done a little bit of manual exploration of my browsing history data. I&amp;rsquo;ve set up a little Python script to be able to access the data programmatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I&amp;rsquo;ll do more manual analysis, and then I&amp;rsquo;ll see if I&amp;rsquo;m able to give Bieber Bot the real-time access to the data that I described above. I&amp;rsquo;m particularly excited to see if I can get the &amp;ldquo;looks like you&amp;rsquo;ve gotten distracted&amp;rdquo; messages set up with Bieber Bot. As a bonus, since Bieber Bot can message other people too, this system could help me leverage social accountability to stay on task.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Today I Learned the Word Feedingstuffs</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2019-12-29-feedingstuffs/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2019-12-29-feedingstuffs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I learned the word 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/feedingstuff#English&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;feedingstuffs&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;feedingstuff (countable and uncountable, plural feedingstuffs)

  Any foodstuff used to feed livestock.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not in every dictionary, and it&amp;rsquo;s not a valid Scrabble word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did this word come up? I had heard previously that salmon is not naturally as pink as it is in supermarkets. I was wondering how this could be. Surely salmon aren&amp;rsquo;t being colored during the packaging process, right? That&amp;rsquo;s right, salmon are still that same color when they&amp;rsquo;re first cut open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coloring, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/safety/docs/animal-feed_additives_rules_scan-old_report_out81.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;I learned&lt;/a&gt;, is added to the salmon&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;feedingstuffs&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that&amp;rsquo;s an official European Commission report from 2002 recommending that the amount of allowable 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canthaxanthin&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Canthaxanthin&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;font color=&#34;salmon&#34;&gt;salmon&lt;/font&gt; coloring) in salmon feed be reevaluated, and possibly lowered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, the maximum amount of Canthaxanthin allowable in salmon and trout feedingstuffs in the EU was 80 mg / kg of feedingstuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to today, and only 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32008R0775&amp;amp;qid=1577681296736&amp;amp;from=EN&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;10 mg / kg of Canthaxanthin is permitted&lt;/a&gt;. More interesting than this though, is that in the 2008 journal reporting this new, lower limit, they instead use the word &lt;strong&gt;foodstuffs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedingstuffs, it would seem, are no more.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learning to Communicate</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2019-12-26-learning-to-communicate/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2019-12-26-learning-to-communicate/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My goal for 2020 is to learn to communicate better with the world. I work in a research group at Google, and our main job function is performing research in program synthesis. But research is only as valuable as how well it is communicated. So in 2020 I&amp;rsquo;d like to get better at communicating publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few options for doing this. The first is writing blog posts. This may be too large an undertaking to do frequently. I&amp;rsquo;d really like something that&amp;rsquo;s lower barrier to do, and with a lower quality bar, so that I can do this more often. The natural alternative with these properties is academic Twitter. However, I want to avoid the addictive nature of Twitter. I also want to write more than 280 characters at a time, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to put every little thing I write in front of people&amp;rsquo;s faces with equal importance. Twitter seems a good place for announcing a new paper or a Python Fire update, but not for sharing a musing like this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to start by silently posting my writings to my website, but in a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets&#34;&gt;separate section&lt;/a&gt; from the main blog. This way when there&amp;rsquo;s something with a little more polish that I think is explicitly worth reading, I can put it in the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/posts&#34;&gt;main blog section&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Bieber&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; about it, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to receive updates for every small writing I put up here, you can use this 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/index.xml&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to receive updates only for major posts, such as new publications or major life updates, you can use this 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/posts/index.xml&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; or you can subscribe here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy early new year!&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2019-12-25-introducing-snippets/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2019-12-25-introducing-snippets/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I&amp;rsquo;m introducing the &amp;ldquo;snippets&amp;rdquo; section of my website. The goal is to give myself a place to post content online that&amp;rsquo;s extremely easy to post to, but isn&amp;rsquo;t featured prominently anywhere on the site. This way I can post things without them needing polish or production value, but still link to them and share them as I see fit.&lt;/p&gt;
