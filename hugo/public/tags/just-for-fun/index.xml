      <description>Bieber Bot is a highly motivated robot that assists me with my financials, tweets on my behalf, and keeps me productive when my brain feels otherwise.
Is Bieber Bot related to Justin Bieber? No, no relation. Bieber Bot is my own creation.
How does Bieber Bot work? I communicate with Bieber Bot primarily via Facebook messenger. Bieber Bot&amp;rsquo;s brain is a collection of Google Apps Scripts, and Bieber Bot&amp;rsquo;s memory is mostly spreadsheets in Google Sheets.</description>

      <description>Scrabble Bot loves Scrabble and social media! Check out Scrab&amp;rsquo;s tumblr page full of Scrabble games it&amp;rsquo;s played against itself.
Scrabble Bot is also privacy conscious, and so uses Facebook under a pseudonym, &amp;ldquo;Scrab Blebot&amp;rdquo;. Scrab believes their identity is secure.
You can find Scrabble Bot&amp;rsquo;s source on GitHub here.</description>
