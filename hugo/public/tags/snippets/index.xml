      <title>On why writing is hard</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2023-01-22-writing-is-hard/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 22 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2023-01-22-writing-is-hard/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing can be challenging. It can feel slow at times. For me, my 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2019-12-30-writing-for-no-audience/&#34;&gt;snippets systems&lt;/a&gt; goes a long way toward mitigating this. In this particular snippet, I present a taxonomy of why writing is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;difficulty-1-rereading&#34;&gt;Difficulty 1: Rereading&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Rereading slows me down.&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can consume significant time, for little benefit compared with writing unwritten sections of the piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I include here going back and making changes or insertions earlier in the writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t meant to diminish the value of revisions or editing. There is a time and place for those. That time and place generally isn&amp;rsquo;t while you&amp;rsquo;re writing your piece though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;difficulty-2-minor-in-comparison-to-1-local-wordsmithing-typo-cleanup-etc&#34;&gt;Difficulty 2 (minor in comparison to #1): Local wordsmithing, typo cleanup, etc&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;As I write, I make mistakes. Fixing them as I make them slows me down.&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my experience with 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/go-note-go/&#34;&gt;Go Note Go&lt;/a&gt;, I know the volume of these mistakes when uncorrected is enormous. Some of the mistakes themselves are hilariously large, like typing 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2023-01-21-repetition/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;nubdsgare&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;mindshare&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; because my hands weren&amp;rsquo;t lined up properly on the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixing this kind of mistake while you&amp;rsquo;re writing is extremely common. I recommend against it though! This of course is extremely difficult (and possibly bad) advice to follow if you&amp;rsquo;re writing with a monitor, because all those typos will distract you. They&amp;rsquo;ll tug hard at you to fix them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, however, you are writing without a monitor, e.g. on Go Note Go, then it is much easier to ignore fixing these local mistakes until later. This can accelerate your first-draft writing significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;difficulty-3-task-switching&#34;&gt;Difficulty 3: Task switching&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;That is, &lt;b&gt;getting distracted&lt;/b&gt;. Of course getting distracted slows me down.&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be by either internal or 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-01-infinite-distractions-and-getting-a-good-sear/&#34;&gt;external distractions&lt;/a&gt;. Both can be harmful toward effective writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/tags/attention/&#34;&gt;the nature of distractions&lt;/a&gt; can be helpful.
Often it can be that a decision point is reached and it&amp;rsquo;s hard to decide (Difficulty #4).
It could be that making progress requires putting yourself out there, e.g. writing something that someone else will read and possibly judge, or clicking send (Difficulty #8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s as simple as not knowing how to spell someone&amp;rsquo;s name. &amp;ldquo;Does Marisa have one S or two? I&amp;rsquo;ll come back to writing this text later.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s needing to choose a name for an event. Or choosing who to invite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s the more common cause of distractions: something shiny and more appealing than writing catches your eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Let&#39;s list the mitigations for this difficulty.&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigation 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Have a clear goal, which when achieved, allows for task switching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigation 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Use Go Note Go (thereby 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2023-01-16-go-note-go-features/&#34;&gt;removing the possibility of editing, rereading, or task switching&lt;/a&gt;). This helps with Difficulties #1, #2, and #3 so far!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigation idea 3:&lt;/strong&gt; As a (more challenging) alternative to Go Note Go, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-01-13-writing-tool-idea/&#34;&gt;implement rules for yourself&lt;/a&gt; that disallow editing, rereading, and task switching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, these first three difficulties capture much of why writing emails, for example, can be challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;difficulty-4-reaching-a-decision-that-you-dont-want-to-make&#34;&gt;Difficulty 4: Reaching a decision that you don&amp;rsquo;t want to make&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Decision-making can fatigue or even end a writing session.&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is worth separating this from Difficulty 3 (Task switching) because it precedes task switching, and can generate difficulty even if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t spur task switching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also worth breaking down further, since not all decision making difficulty is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;four-types-of-decision-making-difficulty&#34;&gt;Four types of decision making difficulty:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;1. Decision appears to reveal inner preference&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resistance to making a decision can form if the decision would reveal (or appear to reveal) an inner preference that you don&amp;rsquo;t want to reveal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt; Choosing a name or a gender for a character when you want to tell the story first, and then choose their name or gender or race (or whatever characteristics are going to get implied by the name selection) later&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigation:&lt;/strong&gt; Just pick a name! You can always change it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigation:&lt;/strong&gt; Use a placeholder. This isn&amp;rsquo;t as good as just picking a name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigation:&lt;/strong&gt; Add a note-to-self that you&amp;rsquo;ll strip on publication if that makes you feel more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;2. Decision requires communication / external stakeholders&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decisions often require additional information not yet available, possibly requiring additional communication or back-and-forths with other people in order to obtain. This can become a blocker toward writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt; Picking a place to meet, or a date and time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this challenging? It&amp;rsquo;s because it relies on having information that might not be available. Gathering the information might require a challenging coordination problem, possibly with chicken-and-the-egg difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigation:&lt;/strong&gt; Be verbose, and provide both a default suggestion as well as information about the level of flexibility in the suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigation:&lt;/strong&gt; Reach out to the people who can provide the information you need immediately, but be clear that you won&amp;rsquo;t necessarily wait for their response to proceed with the original task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can then include in the original writing that you&amp;rsquo;ve reached out to gather the missing information and will follow-up soon.
In general, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/post/2022-01-08-new-messager-setup/&#34;&gt;sending messages earlier&lt;/a&gt; indicating that you&amp;rsquo;ve received and are processing someone else&amp;rsquo;s message is a good idea. You can always write more later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General strategy:&lt;/strong&gt; Respond to emails immediately acknowledging receipt even if you haven&amp;rsquo;t taken the time to thoughtfully respond yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;3. Options are hard to choose between, because they are roughly equal in expected value&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-02-08-future-gameshow-host/&#34;&gt;a choice&lt;/a&gt; is just hard. Sometimes the hardest choices are hard because the expected outcomes are important, but not clearly better one way or the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt; Choosing between job offers, or between pieces of art to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigation:&lt;/strong&gt; Use the penguin approach. Then pick one as the default, and proceed to ask if each subsequent possible choice is better; if it is, update the default (aka &amp;ldquo;the penguin&amp;rdquo;) to that choice. When it comes time to finally choose, select the penguin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;4. A decision could be difficult for another reason: because the negative consequences of the best choice are hard to stomach&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt; A break up or a layoff, or other form of giving someone bad news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigation:&lt;/strong&gt; Be empathetic. There&amp;rsquo;s no good way to deliver bad news, but there are worse ways. Be human, and supportive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;difficulty-5-deciding-what-to-say&#34;&gt;Difficulty 5: Deciding what to say&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;This can appear to be a difficulty when in actuality the difficulty is in Difficulty 1: Rereading.&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, you might finish an idea and have to decide what to write next, so you reread what you&amp;rsquo;ve written to refresh your idea. This is already slowing you down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigation:&lt;/strong&gt; Make an outline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigation:&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of choosing what to write (if there are two options even with your outline) as if its a final choice, realize that you can write both options and keep whichever or both that you like later, during editing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deciding what to say can, of course, also be a difficulty in and of itself, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For completeness, I list three additional difficulties here without additional comment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;difficulty-6-editing&#34;&gt;Difficulty 6: Editing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;difficulty-7-finding-draft-readers&#34;&gt;Difficulty 7: Finding draft readers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;difficulty-8-clicking-submit&#34;&gt;Difficulty 8: Clicking submit&lt;/h3&gt;

      <title>Chat by Tag</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2022-06-20-chat-by-tag/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2022-06-20-chat-by-tag/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have a comments section on my website, but I do like when people reach out to me by email.
I am thinking about an idea for adding chat to my website, but the experience I have in mind is different from any chat or comments section that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen before.
Here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about and why &amp;ndash; please do let me know if it exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of each snippet there would be a badge for each tag associated with that snippet, as there already is today.
Each badge would indicate that there is a chat thread available for that tag.
E.g. it would show the number of active users and amount of recent activity in the chatroom.
Clicking the badge would take you to the tag&amp;rsquo;s page, which would list all the snippets having that tag.
The tag page would now also house the tag&amp;rsquo;s chat thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the tag page you could engage in real time chat, and your messages would stay up for a week (or until I take them down, in the case of spam).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My website is not particularly heavily trafficked, but enough people email me about the things I write that this features interests me.
I don&amp;rsquo;t envision any of the chats having any content the majority of the time.
I would set the lifetime of a message to just one week.
Between the low traffic and ephemerality of the messages, most of the chats would be empty most of the time.
I would set up email notifications for myself though, so that I know if someone does post a message.
So at the very least, I could reply, even if few others see the messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As often happens when writing a snippet about an idea I&amp;rsquo;ve had, I start looking into how to implement it concurrently with writing it.
I&amp;rsquo;ve looked at Rocket.Chat, Slack, and Discord, and am currently investigating whether using widgetbot.io to provide access to a Discord server might be a solid solution here.
What follows is my initial attempt at including Discord directly in this snippet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details id=&#34;chat-details-inline&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary markdown=&#34;span&#34;&gt;Expand this to see the embedded chat.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;widgetbot
    server=&#34;695290335823265862&#34;
    channel=&#34;988521423603654686&#34;
    width=&#34;100%&#34;
    height=&#34;600&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/widgetbot&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to be working quite well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, given that this tool is readily available, I will compromise on my original vision some.
I think what I&amp;rsquo;ll do now is (1) find a way to lazily load the chat so people who don&amp;rsquo;t want to deal with it aren&amp;rsquo;t bothered by it,
and then (2) I&amp;rsquo;ll add it (behind an expandable section) to every snippet and every tags page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll set up a Discord server with one channel per tag. On the tag pages, the chat will default open to that tag&amp;rsquo;s channel.
On the individual snippets, the chat will default open to the first tag present on the page.
Users can easily switch to other channels if they so desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how to lazy load? This turned out to be simple enough to implement quite quickly. I added some JavaScript to the page that loads the widgetbot JavaScript only when the collapsed chat is expanded. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;
let chatLoaded = false;
const details = document.querySelector(&#39;#chat-details&#39;);
details.addEventListener(&amp;quot;toggle&amp;quot;, event =&amp;gt; {
  if (details.open &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !chatLoaded) {
    const script = document.createElement(&#39;script&#39;);
    script.src = &amp;quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@widgetbot/html-embed&amp;quot;;
    document.head.appendChild(script);
    chatLoaded = true;
  }
});
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Why am I showing this code? It is not germane to the story. A: This is a snippet, and so I guess I do not curate the content like I would if the goal were a proper story. It&amp;rsquo;s meant for future me as much as for anyone else.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
let chatLoadedInline = false;
const detailsInline = document.querySelector(&#39;#chat-details-inline&#39;);
detailsInline.addEventListener(&#34;toggle&#34;, event =&gt; {
  if (detailsInline.open &amp;&amp; !chatLoadedInline) {
    const script = document.createElement(&#39;script&#39;);
    script.src = &#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@widgetbot/html-embed&#34;;
    document.head.appendChild(script);
    chatLoadedInline = true;
  }
});
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having set up the lazy loading, the next step was to create channels for each of the tags on my site.
There are a lot of tags, so I used Browserflow to do this quickly. A joy as always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I&amp;rsquo;ll have to update my website so that the appropriate chat gets added to the appropriate page. (I&amp;rsquo;m back, and that&amp;rsquo;s done now :).)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve tagged this post with &amp;ldquo;Ask Me Anywhere&amp;rdquo; because, like my original Ask Me Anywhere ideas, this is about allowing for more direct engagement between me and people on the site. I&amp;rsquo;ve also tagged this &amp;ldquo;Snippets&amp;rdquo;, because it&amp;rsquo;s primarily about a change to the snippets section of my website, and &amp;ldquo;Browserflow&amp;rdquo; because Browserflow was a joy to use for setting up this new system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I&amp;rsquo;m concluding the snippet. The system is up and running. That was certainly not my expectation when I started writing this, but I&amp;rsquo;m delighted by the progress I made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;As an aside, David, expand this for a reminder of how to add a new tag.&lt;/summary&gt;
There will be some maintenance work necessary whenever I add a snippet with a new tag. Let me summarize the maintenance for myself here for easy reference:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new channel in the Discord.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the tag name and channel id to the map at the top of the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dbieber/davidbieber.com/blob/master/hugo/layouts/partials/discussion.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;discussion.html partial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site won&amp;rsquo;t fail to build if you forget to do this; it will just have a broken chat section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That should be it. See you in the chats!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Writing Another Snippet on Go Note Go</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2022-03-07-snippets-on-gng-ii/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2022 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2022-03-07-snippets-on-gng-ii/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After thinking through 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2022-03-06-gng-snippets-divide/&#34;&gt;the tension between Go Note Go and snippets&lt;/a&gt; yesterday,
I now wonder if there&amp;rsquo;s a good way to write a snippet draft on Go Note Go.
I&amp;rsquo;ve done so 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-09-27-snippet-on-go-note-go/&#34;&gt;once before&lt;/a&gt;, when Go Note Go was only two weeks old, so I know it&amp;rsquo;s possible. But five months later I&amp;rsquo;ve written many snippet-worthy ideas on Go Note Go, but no additional snippets, which leads me to ask &amp;ldquo;why?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first question I would need to answer is at what point during the writing of a snippet draft do I have to know that I&amp;rsquo;m writing a snippet draft. If I have to know upfront, that suggests one interface, whereas if I discover halfway into writing something that I think I&amp;rsquo;m writing a snippet draft, that suggests a different UX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I know upfront, I can create a new session (in the Roam uploader) using shift-enter, and then I can simply type the full snippet draft. That&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m doing now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, however, I discover midway into typing something that I&amp;rsquo;m typing a snippet draft, then it may begin in the middle of a session. This isn&amp;rsquo;t such a big deal; when I clean up the draft I can remove the initial segment that isn&amp;rsquo;t meant to be part of the snippet. The start of the snippet, when I didn&amp;rsquo;t know I was writing a snippet, might be muddier than the rest, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t stand in the way of producing snippet-quality content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both cases, I&amp;rsquo;ll want a way to indicate that I&amp;rsquo;ve written a snippet draft so that I can find it later.
(At this point in the snippet writing I encountered a bug &amp;ndash; notes that contained quotation marks were being dropped! I&amp;rsquo;ve now 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dbieber/GoNoteGo/pull/32&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;fixed this bug&lt;/a&gt;, and am recreating the lost content from this snippet as follows.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple option is to use a hashtag to indicate where a snippet draft lives. If I were working in Roam directly, I would use a two-word hashtag, &amp;ldquo;#[[Snippet draft]]&amp;rdquo;. However, this is a mouthful to type on Go Note Go, which lacks autocomplete (how do you design an autocomplete experience suitable for a headless keyboard?), since getting all that syntax exactly correct is tricky (a hash &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; double-brackets!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If instead we adopt the hyphenated #snippet-draft then the double-brackets become unnecessary. Still simpler is the single word #draft. This seems the easiest to get right consistently if I&amp;rsquo;m going to be typing it in the dark while half asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll adopt that convention for now, and revisit later as needed (it seems unlikely it will be needed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#draft&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This system seems great for writing snippet drafts at GNG when I&amp;rsquo;m in a comfortable typing position, such as at a desk. There does seem to be something missing for when I&amp;rsquo;m drifting off to sleep though, as I often am when using GNG. I&amp;rsquo;m currently comfortably stationed at a desk, so I&amp;rsquo;ll defer thinking through the sleep-GNG-usage snippet writing scenario until after I sleep on it some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having now completed this snippet draft, I&amp;rsquo;m going to head to a computer with a monitor in order to publish it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Hello from the computer-with-monitor! This snippet is headed for publication now!)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Go Note Go / Snippets Divide</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2022-03-06-gng-snippets-divide/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 06 Mar 2022 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2022-03-06-gng-snippets-divide/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love using Go Note Go. Sitting down with no screen, just a keyboard, feels really good.
It clears my head, and straightens out my thoughts. I imagine meditation feels similar to some people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, Go Note Go is fulfilling some of the early objectives of 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/&#34;&gt;snippets&lt;/a&gt;.
It allows me to &lt;em&gt;write&lt;/em&gt; without hesitation or uncertainty.
However, that was not precisely 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2019-12-30-writing-for-no-audience/&#34;&gt;my goal with snippets&lt;/a&gt;.
My goal with snippets was to be able to &lt;em&gt;write publicly&lt;/em&gt; without hesitation or uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming back to write this snippet, having written so much on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/go-note-go/&#34;&gt;Go Note Go&lt;/a&gt; lately,
snippet-writing feels a little heavier than it used to.
It feels a little more like I&amp;rsquo;m writing something public, whereas for so long
snippet-writing had felt like I was writing for no audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, this heaviness faded quickly. Even four paragraphs into this snippet, having now spent a full minute or more reminding myself of my rules and efforts for keeping the barrier to publication low, this feels easy to write again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, there is a tension between Go Note Go writing and snippet writing that this minute of thinking does not resolve.
The tension is this:
I write so much in Go Note Go, including dozens of ideas that would be great to publish for snippets,
but as a result of writing them in Go Note Go, I am less inclined to make snippets of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this? Is it because I have a limited amount of snippet-quality writing time in me, and I&amp;rsquo;ve repurposed it for Go Note Go writing? Is it because writing something I&amp;rsquo;ve already written about is less enjoyable than writing something new? I think it&amp;rsquo;s a combination of these things, more the latter than the former.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I write in Go Note Go, the quality bar is &lt;em&gt;even lower&lt;/em&gt; than for snippets (hard to imagine, I know).
The Go Note Go writing is full of typos and repetitions. The typos are there because I cannot see when I&amp;rsquo;m writing; I do not go back to correct anything because there&amp;rsquo;s no mechanism for it.
Also because Go Note Go is not published anywhere, I can drop inhibitions even further than I do for snippet writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I&amp;rsquo;ve put a snippet idea into Go Note Go, in principle it should be easier to turn into a snippet.
It&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of cleaning up the text from Go Note Go to make it snippet-worthy.
Snippet-worthy is a much lower bar than story-worthy.
However, cleaning up text from Go Note Go to produce a snippet doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem as rewarding as writing a snippet from scratch. Snippet-writing is like thinking; Go Note Go-cleaning is another type of activity altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, there are ideas in my Go Note Go writing that I do want to publish. So, my proposed strategy is this: I&amp;rsquo;ll write snippets about those ideas from scratch, when it feels appropriate to do so. I already review my Go Note Go notes periodically, so now when I do so I&amp;rsquo;ll keep an eye out for snippet-worthy ideas. By doing so, I think there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance some of them will turn themselves into snippets simply by virtue of being sufficiently interesting to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest such idea that comes to mind is 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2022-07-20-keyboards-everywhere/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Keyboards, keyboards, everywhere, and not a spot to think.&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;
This is a blog post idea I&amp;rsquo;ve written multiple parts of in different places, but which I haven&amp;rsquo;t pulled together into its complete form yet. It&amp;rsquo;s a post about the promise of technology, how attention-seeking tech has prevented us from delivering on that promise, and how headless keyboards like Go Note Go provide a path toward reclaiming our attention and allowing us to reach out fullest potential as users of modern tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/posts/&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; isn&amp;rsquo;t a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/&#34;&gt;snippet&lt;/a&gt;, but I&amp;rsquo;ve decided (after initial hesitation) that it would be totally fine to produce snippets using content that will ideally eventually make it into a blog post.
This is similar to my decision to allow myself to publish incomplete snippets.
It trades off some novelty when the blog post is finally published in return for keeping the bar to publishing snippets extraordinarily low. I value that goal more than I value preserving any kind of surprisal when I publish a blog post, rare as that is.
So, I&amp;rsquo;m likely to write about the &amp;ldquo;Keyboards, keyboards, everywhere, and not a spot to think&amp;rdquo; idea in snippets well before producing the blog post I aspire for it. (Update: 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2022-07-20-keyboards-everywhere/&#34;&gt;Done here!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In writing this snippet, I trawled through some of my Go Note Go writing. It&amp;rsquo;s fun for me to look through. It&amp;rsquo;s a distraction from finishing this snippet though. I look forward to writing snippets about some of the ideas I encounter in these Go Note Go expeditions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Applying Lessons from Snippets to LaLTaL</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2022-01-18-snippets-lessons-for-laltal/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2022-01-18-snippets-lessons-for-laltal/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.laltal.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;LaLTal &amp;ndash; short for &amp;ldquo;learn a little, teach a little&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;
is a novel learning app from John Cumbers
built on the extraordinary power of learning by teaching.
I tried it out tonight, and I had a great time learning a bit about blockchain and synthetic biology.
I really appreciated the opportunity to practice explaining the concepts that came up in the questions. Coming up with these explanations on the spot felt like exercising an underutilized muscle. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing more of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I think could really improve the experience further though
would be if recording was decoupled from production.
The simplest way of doing this would be a &amp;ldquo;draft record&amp;rdquo; button,
and a more interesting way would be a more sophisticated but still simple audio editor, an idea I&amp;rsquo;ll detail later on in this snippet.
The core of my suggestion isn&amp;rsquo;t about the difference in &lt;em&gt;functionality&lt;/em&gt; between a potential &amp;ldquo;draft record&amp;rdquo; feature and the current &amp;ldquo;record&amp;rdquo; feature.
Instead, it&amp;rsquo;s about the mindset that the UI induces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/&#34;&gt;snippets&lt;/a&gt;.
When I write these snippets, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2019-12-30-writing-for-no-audience/&#34;&gt;I write them for no audience&lt;/a&gt;.
I don&amp;rsquo;t expect to share them, or for people to read them,
and that makes them easier to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This snippet is an exception; I fully expect to share it with a few people once it&amp;rsquo;s written. Maybe. There&amp;rsquo;s still a piece of my mind that knows that it might just be an ordinary snippet, never shared. And certainly it won&amp;rsquo;t share widely or automatically when it&amp;rsquo;s published. I can put it on my website without anyone ever seeing it, at which point deciding to share it becomes a much lighter weight action than a single decision to both &lt;em&gt;write and share it&lt;/em&gt; would have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from writing snippets is that it&amp;rsquo;s easier to produce content when you&amp;rsquo;re not doing it for anyone, or with any intention to share it.
Of course, I don&amp;rsquo;t know how true this is for everyone, but I suspect that since it is true for me, it applies to some reasonably sized portion of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lesson from writing snippets can be applied to LaLTaL too.
If the app put people in a mindset where they felt like they weren&amp;rsquo;t recording a final explanation to be shared,
but rather were trying on the words for size,
I think people could reach a point where they understand the material better and are more capable of sharing it.
They might even produce something they want to share even if they didn&amp;rsquo;t start the recording intending for it to be the version for sharing; I know that&amp;rsquo;s happened to me in writing snippets loads of times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening to other people&amp;rsquo;s explanations in the app
left me with a couple of observations &amp;ndash; possible shortcomings in people&amp;rsquo;s answers that I think setting the right mindset or environment might be able to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People move quickly over complicated parts to keep their explanation short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw this multiple times in people&amp;rsquo;s explanations of blockchain-related concepts.
When people got to the part of the explanation about cryptographic hash functions,
instead of recognizing the limitation in either their explanation or their understanding, they swept it under the rug in order to keep the explanation fluid and &amp;ldquo;appropriate&amp;rdquo; in length. I think the current record-once setup leaves people averse to grappling with complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If people felt like a long pause to think right in the middle of their explanation were OK, they maybe they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t exhibit this sweeping-under-the-rug behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People speak slowly to buy themselves time to think, rather than pausing to think or thinking ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reminds me a bit of 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cA9j2EpAHE&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Charlie Brown&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Book Report&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name of the book about which,
this book report is about is,
Peter Rabbit which is about this&amp;hellip;
Rabbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as someone answering the questions, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with this!
It&amp;rsquo;s a great way to feel your way toward a good answer. During the slow explanation, your brain is hard at work piecing together what you&amp;rsquo;ll say next.
Still, I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to recognize that this is happening and that there might be a UX that leads to a better experience for both answerer and listener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If people felt like they could record in multiple pieces, pause as long as they like to think, and throw out individual pieces,
perhaps they would produce even better explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People trail off with uncertainty and apprehension&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happened in several of the explanations I listened to.
The speaker is explaining something, it&amp;rsquo;s going well, and then they realize they&amp;rsquo;re either about to repeat themself or have nothing more to add.
So, they trail off, their voice weakens a little, and they remark that they&amp;rsquo;re done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If instead people were recording for themselves,
hearing themselves think through the various aspects of their answer,
and then at the end piecing together the parts of their own musings that they like,
it would avoid these tenuous endings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this leads me to brainstorm possible user interface ideas.
Know that the purpose of this snippet is not to advocate for any single idea,
but rather simply to share my thinking.
My aim is for these ideas to inspire further ones, not for these ideas to win out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;version-1-multiple-recordings&#34;&gt;Version 1: Multiple recordings&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This is simpler to implement, but I imagine less effective, than Version 2.)
The idea here is you can record multiple recordings &amp;ndash; as many as you like &amp;ndash; and then you can rearrange them or delete them.
With this UX, already an answerer can comfortably pause their recording if they feel they&amp;rsquo;ve reached a part of the explanation that their stumbling over. They can gather their thoughts, then proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;version-2-a-single-multi-piece-recording&#34;&gt;Version 2: A single multi-piece recording.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This UX could be simpler for the user, but is more technically ambitious.)
When you start recording,
the screen begins filling up with your recording.
Each time you pause speaking for more than two seconds,
a boundary appears in your recording.
The boundaries effectively divide time into distinct clips.
Silence is stripped from the beginning and end of each clip automatically.
As in Version 1 of the idea, the answerer has the opportunity to rearrange or delete clips by tapping and dragging them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a tension between these UX ideas and another important aspect of getting people to publish, that must be carefully balanced.
If people have opportunities to critique their own work, and polish it, they may be reluctant to publish because the mental quality bar they set for themselves could be too high.
This has been another critical lesson from snippets &amp;ndash; making the quality bar to publication as low as possible has been essential for me feeling comfortable writing and publishing my snippets.
Editing tools push the quality bar higher, and so the UX ideas I present above might have opposite the desired effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, I present a third version of the UX, one that balances the desire to let people pause and think with the goal of keeping people feeling comfortable publishing rather than falling into a perfection-trap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;version-3-one-recording-with-a-pause-feature&#34;&gt;Version 3: One recording with a &amp;ldquo;Pause&amp;rdquo; feature&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this final variant of the idea, the user pushes to record,
but they can pause and resume their recording at any time.
Simply by letting people pause, perhaps we can give people the freedom to think before they speak when they encounter a tough concept unexpectedly during their explanation.
At the same time, this keeps the recording UX simple, so hopefully it avoids the potential pitfall of having people avoid clicking submit because they have reached the perfect recording yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully the result is explanations that are both cogent, fun to produce, and plentiful.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Two Snippets I want to write about GNG and Messager</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2022-01-08-gng-messager-snippet-plans/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2022 02:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2022-01-08-gng-messager-snippet-plans/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have two new ideas for snippets I want to write. They&amp;rsquo;re about Go Note Go and Messager Queue, both side projects I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting a bunch of time into the last few days. The snippet ideas are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using Go Note Go as an outliner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding Hacker News to Messager Queue, and then auto-queuing Twitter and HN posts for snippets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is about &lt;em&gt;using Go Note Go as an outliner&lt;/em&gt;. This is a new feature I&amp;rsquo;ve added to Go Note Go just in the last day or so. Before yesterday, each note entered via Go Note Go was it&amp;rsquo;s own bullet in your note-taking system. Now (at least for Roam), you can also use tab to indent and dedent notes.
This sounds simple, but thinking through the user experience, taking into consideration that there is no screen, was a fun experience.
It also sounds like an only marginal improvement, but for me it&amp;rsquo;s been rewarding more than I expected. It has interesting interactions with the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/post/2022-01-08-new-messager-setup/&#34;&gt;new message sending feature&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; making sending messages even more enjoyable.
And it lends itself well to progressive summarization and chronologically organized notes;
with the current implementation, each note-taking &amp;ldquo;session&amp;rdquo; has a timestamp and blank space for a summary at the top of the session. I can fill in the blank space and then collapse the notes, making it easier to skim through them later.
Perhaps these summaries will serve as training / fine-tuning data for an autosummarizer later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second snippet idea is a new script I am thinking of writing that will add messages to my new Messager Queue automatically.
I&amp;rsquo;ve toyed with the idea of sharing more of my snippets publicly in the past.
Currently, I only share them very rarely.
Only partially is this an active decision; it is also partially inertia and there being an activation energy and unnaturalness for me in posting publicly.
While the active decision reasons will remain, having auto-generated messages populate my Messager Queue periodically will really dilute any inertia / activation energy / unnaturalness reasons for not sharing snippets, and those are precisely the reasons I want to eliminate.
Doing this will require a small change to the Messager Queue to support Hacker News; this should only take a few minutes, as HN is already supported by Messager.
Then, it will likely take a few hours to write a script that periodically adds messages about my snippets to my Messager Queue.
One source of these messages will be the &amp;ldquo;message&amp;rdquo; field at the top of some of my snippet frontmatters.
For others I can just make a templated message using the snippet title; the beauty of Messager Queue is I don&amp;rsquo;t need to autogenerate the perfect message, since I can tweak or rewrite it before approving the message to go out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;rsquo;ve now put down all the things I wanted to say about those two snippets. Does it still make sense to write them? I don&amp;rsquo;t know; I might turn them into new snippets anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I made a new Post, but why?</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2022-01-08-new-post-why/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2022 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2022-01-08-new-post-why/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The last two years I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly been writing snippets, but today I wrote 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/post/2022-01-08-new-messager-setup&#34;&gt;a new post&lt;/a&gt;. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I initially wrote it as a snippet.
And the total time it took to write was short, like a snippet, not long like a typical post.
So there are reasons to think it is not unlike other snippets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I chose to publish it as a post rather than as a snippet is it seemed more significant.
The last few days, playing with all the progress I&amp;rsquo;ve made in Go Note Go and Messager, left me wanting to share my work with other people. So, by publishing it as a post, it will be more prominent on my website, and over time more people will see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another small reason is I hadn&amp;rsquo;t made a post in a long time. By converting this snippet into a post, I maintain a pattern of periodic posting of posts. When someone (likely me) looks at the list of post dates, there won&amp;rsquo;t be a large gap, even if I don&amp;rsquo;t write another post for a year.
So, I suppose I wanted to remove any internal pressure for writing posts that may have been building up.
At first I thought that describing this reason, I would end by noting that it&amp;rsquo;s a shallow reason;
after all, the appearance of consistent posting feels like a shallow thing to me.
Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve written it out though, I realize it&amp;rsquo;s more about managing the expectations set by a small shallow piece of me, not just about conceding to that piece.
It is, in part, me conceding to that piece though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally &amp;ndash; last reason &amp;ndash; it had the right heft and length to feel OK as a post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Snippets in Other Languages</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-11-16-other-languages/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-11-16-other-languages/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bonjour, hello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puedo escribir en otras linguas. No necessito escribir todos mis snippetos en Inglés. Como se dice &amp;ldquo;snippets&amp;rdquo; en Español? Parece que la palabra es fragmentos, pero la sección es mía, y puedo llamarlo lo que quiero. Por ahora, los llamaré &amp;ldquo;snippetos&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En particular&amp;hellip; želim pisati na hrvatski. Svaki dan učim hrvatski, ali sam još uvijek beginner. Čitam easy-croatian.com za učenje. Radim flashcards i radim spaced repetition, ali ja sum na Chapter 17, a ima 100 Chapters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hay mucho que aprender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kako se kaže &amp;ldquo;beginner&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;chapter&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;17&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;100&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;flashcard&amp;rdquo;, i &amp;ldquo;spaced repetition&amp;rdquo; na hrvatski? Google Translate kaže &amp;ldquo;beginner&amp;rdquo; je &amp;ldquo;početnik&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;chapter&amp;rdquo; je &amp;ldquo;poglavlje&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;17&amp;rdquo; je &amp;ldquo;sedamnaest&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;100&amp;rdquo; je &amp;ldquo;sto&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;flashcard&amp;rdquo; je &amp;ldquo;flash kartica&amp;rdquo;, i &amp;ldquo;spaced repetition&amp;rdquo; je &amp;ldquo;razmaknuto ponavljanje&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haré flash kartice para estas palabras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s absolutely wonderful that I can use snippets to practice writing in languages I&amp;rsquo;m not comfortable with. This would be so difficult with a traditional blog, because the readership wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be there, the comfort level wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be there. Try to imagine it: a traditional blog, or a blog with thousands of regular readers (or even dozens), sending out a post like this one. The audience wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be interested; they don&amp;rsquo;t speak the language the post is written it, and the quality is low. Most writers wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do it, and the audience wouldn&amp;rsquo;t respond well if they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have those problems, and this brings me a lovely feeling of satisfaction. The snippets system is excellent to me. Of course, the trade-off is clear. There is no regular readership to be turned off by a post like this. To me, this is indubitably worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Writing a Snippet with Go Note Go</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-09-27-snippet-on-go-note-go/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-09-27-snippet-on-go-note-go/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been developing and concurrently using Go Note Go for two weeks now, and in that time I have come to love the frictionless way it allows me to dump thoughts into the machine. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a chance to reread what I&amp;rsquo;ve written. There&amp;rsquo;s no going back and rewording something. And more than that, there&amp;rsquo;s no waiting for the characters to show up, or switching tabs, or spell checking or anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time I&amp;rsquo;m writing a snippet using Go Note Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about writing a snippet about Go Note Go over the last two weeks, but I decided not to until yesterday when I finally stopped keeping Go Note Go to myself.
I thought maybe there would be value in getting Go Note Go polished, e.g. writing a getting started guide or even a sales page, and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; publishing it once people can actually use it themselves.
But I decided against that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Done is better than perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might not find a good way to package Go Note Go so that people can start using it with relative ease.
Certainly I can do better than I have so far − there&amp;rsquo;s little help at all for someone to put together their own system.
That said, a motivated individual could in principle piece together their own Go Note Go from what I&amp;rsquo;ve published now.
And I&amp;rsquo;d be happy to help them do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even if someone had to ask too many questions or can&amp;rsquo;t reproduce the full setup, maybe they&amp;rsquo;ll take the concept in a new direction.
&amp;ldquo;Headless note−taking&amp;rdquo; is a broad idea and I&amp;rsquo;ve just scratched the surface.
We can see from shh shell and Go Note Go alone that there are diverse approaches one can take to this broad concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to take it further myself, but more than that I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to start the conversation about headless note−taking since it might be able to help a much broader set of people than it&amp;rsquo;s helping right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it would be great in classrooms to avoid distractions.
Maybe there are headless audio−only applications for writers, for programmers, for producers, for lawyers and doctors and publicists and influencers and so forth that are just waiting to be developed.
Different keyboard shortcuts could be specialized for different domains. The addition of foot peddles might help some users. Whatever is needed to make this maximally useful for different applications and different people&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s already super useful for people, but there&amp;rsquo;s just no way for those people to know right now because they can&amp;rsquo;t easily try it, or haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of it and thought about it. This is wishful thinking of course; it might be an esoteric toy that is only useful or fun for a small group, but I&amp;rsquo;m confident that group is larger than just myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I want to put this out there a little bit. I&amp;rsquo;d like to share it with Conor of Roam, and with Andy Matuschak, and with folks at IdeaFlow and with Notion users, and with Obsidian folks, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I&amp;rsquo;d like to get out of sharing with these groups is contributors to the extensible uploader side of Go Note Go.
I think it would be so cool if each supported note−taking system had an uploader contributed by someone working at that note−taking system&amp;rsquo;s company. Conor or Bardia could make a contribution to the Roam uploader. Jacob or Linus could write the IdeaFlow uploader. Someone from Obsidian and Notion could provide uploaders for each of those. Now that the GitHub for the project is public, this is easier to start working toward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the more I think about the getting started guide, the easier it seems to write. There are only a few steps you really need to follow to get set up. Roughly, it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acquire the parts (Raspberry Pi, MicroSD card, optional battery pack, USB cords, a speaker and microphone compatible with the Pi (a Voice Bonnet is one option, but any will do.))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clone Go Note Go&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit config&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put start script in rc.local file to start on startup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be sure to configure your wifi wpa config file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wishful thinking again: I could probably write a decent guide in under an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A torrent of snippets!</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-06-17-a-torrent-of-snippets/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Jun 2021 03:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-06-17-a-torrent-of-snippets/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A torrent of snippets!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I&amp;rsquo;m putting out four snippets all at once is I have time to relax on this plane to Austin. The reason I haven&amp;rsquo;t been writing snippets in the month leading up to this&amp;hellip; I think I was shaken from the habit by the NeurIPS deadline, and then didn&amp;rsquo;t take the habit back up after the deadline passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find this pattern recurring, and I remember I was already aware of it at least as far back as 2013. The pattern is: I develop a habit, I am diligent at keeping that habit until it&amp;rsquo;s broken by some event (usually travel), and then I&amp;rsquo;m slow to take the habit back up if I do at all after the perturbation has subsided. In this case, travel is actually the thing leading me to pick the snippets habit back up, rather than the thing to break the habit (although perhaps my snippets-stopping did correspond to a travel time; I&amp;rsquo;d need to look at a calendar to double check.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, noticing this pattern suggests a way to combat it, to keep habits through these perturbations. It will require some diligence, but I think the trick is to anticipate the perturbation and make a plan to reignite the habit after its conclusion. For example, if I&amp;rsquo;m traveling for a weekend, I could schedule an email to myself saying &amp;ldquo;resume habit X&amp;rdquo; to be delivered a couple days after I get back from my travels, when I expect the perturbation to have fully passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;rsquo;ll leave a message for my future self here and now, for next Wednesday:
David, on Wednesday June 23, resume the &amp;ldquo;Snippets&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;After Work Activities&amp;rdquo; habits.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-05-02-snippet-tags/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I added tags to my snippets. Today, I updated the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/tags/&#34;&gt;tags page&lt;/a&gt; to display the number of snippets containing the tag. Now I can easily see what topics I write about the most, and which I&amp;rsquo;ve written about only a little. Here&amp;rsquo;s where the counts stand today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/tags/princeton-acm/&#34;&gt;Princeton ACM (2)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking this over, I think I&amp;rsquo;d like to normalize the format of the tags. The ones with capital letters at the end date from before I started snippets; those are the tags I used to categorize the projects on my website. I also see I&amp;rsquo;ve only written about puzzles twice. Perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll write about puzzles more. Also, why is there no tag to find all snippets about Bieber Bot? I&amp;rsquo;ll have to fix this.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What links here?</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-24-backlinks/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 24 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-24-backlinks/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write about backlinks today but didn&amp;rsquo;t get a chance (except you&amp;rsquo;re reading it, so of course I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; get a chance in the end).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick outline of what I was hoping to write about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backlinks appear in Roam Research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a BrowserFlow flow that uses Google search to produce backlinks for any website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And I saw that either some of Gwern&amp;rsquo;s writing or Less Wrong includes a &amp;ldquo;What links here?&amp;rdquo; section (it wasn&amp;rsquo;t clear to me which of Gwern or LessWrong was providing this functionality)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A backlink on a page X is an indication of what other content links to X. Seeing a list of backlinks can be mildly interesting, and I was curious to see what pages link to my own writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some visibility into this through a couple different mechanisms. This website uses Google Analytics, so I can see where traffic comes from. This provides a decent view into what other websites are linking to my content. I can also see how traffic flows through my own site, which gives a limited view of the links between snippets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second mechanism I can use to see what links to a snippet is Google Search&amp;rsquo;s exact match feature. Searching for a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22https://davidbieber.com/snippets/%22&amp;#43;-site:https://davidbieber.com/snippets/&amp;amp;filter=0&amp;amp;biw=1648&amp;amp;bih=946&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;complete URL in quotes, optionally with &amp;ldquo;-site:urlgoeshereagain&amp;rdquo; in the query to remove links from the same domain,&lt;/a&gt; will show you what websites link to the page of interest. For example, the query 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22davidbieber.com/post/2019-12-29-track-your-life-in-a-spreadsheet/%22&amp;#43;-site:davidbieber.com&amp;amp;filter=0&amp;amp;biw=1648&amp;amp;bih=946&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;davidbieber.com/post/2019-12-29-track-your-life-in-a-spreadsheet/&amp;rdquo; -site:davidbieber.com&lt;/a&gt; shows links to 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/post/2019-12-29-track-your-life-in-a-spreadsheet/&#34;&gt;my Track Your Life in a Spreadsheet blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was toying with the idea of adding some curated backlinks to snippets. Each snippet would show what other snippets reference it, as well as selected pages from around the web that reference it. Of course, there aren&amp;rsquo;t really pages around the web that reference my snippets, so this idea is moot at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Incomplete snippets</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-23-incomplete-snippets/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-23-incomplete-snippets/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday and two days ago I started writing 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-22-sensible-units&#34;&gt;a snippet called &amp;ldquo;sensible units &amp;ndash; per capita isn&amp;rsquo;t enough&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. In this snippet I take statements with big numbers and rewrite them to make them more intuitive. For example &amp;ldquo;The global population growth rate is about 1.05% per year.&amp;rdquo; becomes &amp;ldquo;In a city of 100,000 (like Mountain View, or New Haven), the population rises by about 1050 people each year (1850 births, 700 deaths). That&amp;rsquo;s 5 new babies a day in this city on average!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t finish the snippet though. While I hope to finish the snippet and publish it this weekend, this experience also made me think about how to publish incomplete snippets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had other incomplete snippets over the years. Peer Learning Group was initially an incomplete snippet back in July 2020, which I never published. Eventually (in January 2021) I decided to launch PLG without &amp;ldquo;finishing&amp;rdquo; the idea as I&amp;rsquo;d originally intended. The original idea was going to rely more heavily on automation and in principle could scale well. The actual idea I went with had a fair bit of manual coordination work, but was definitely worthwhile (in part because it actually happened!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My idea for publishing incomplete snippets is: to start, simply publish the snippet with a label &amp;ldquo;incomplete&amp;rdquo; in the title. Then, if I decide to continue the snippet, I will make a copy of the incomplete snippet, and change the date. If I finish it, I will remove incomplete from the title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I have a complete version of the snippet (which might sometimes never happen), I can link from the complete version to all the incomplete versions that preceded it. I may also remove the incomplete snippets from the main snippets index once a complete version is available. Or in that main index I may make the main link go to the complete version, with a smaller link that goes to the incomplete version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea requires a bit of development, but in the spirit of the idea itself, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll start publishing incomplete snippets even while the incomplete-snippet-publication-idea is itself incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Resuming snippet writing?</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-17-resuming-snippet-writing/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-17-resuming-snippet-writing/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;About two month ago I encountered a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-21-snippets-dry-spell/&#34;&gt;snippets dry spell&lt;/a&gt;. At the time I didn&amp;rsquo;t foresee writing snippets at the same rate I had been leading up to that point. Sure enough, over the two months that followed I only wrote a handful of snippets. March saw two simultaneous Peer Learning Groups, and April lead into a period of intense virtual ping pong playing and lots of real-life hiking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wrapped up the Peer Learning Groups, a largely asynchronous low-commitment activity, with a virtual synchronous meet-up and coworking session. During these I produced these two snippets about what I learned for my PLG sessions: one on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-15-oil-pricing/&#34;&gt;Laser Eye Surgery&lt;/a&gt;, one on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-15-oil-pricing/&#34;&gt;Oil Pricing&lt;/a&gt;. I think this could be the trigger that brings me back into the pattern of writing snippets again, though I&amp;rsquo;m not certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting out to write snippets once more, I have a handful of half-baked ideas about what to write about: sleep, ping pong, virtual reality, hiking, the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-21-snippets-dry-spell/&#34;&gt;list of ideas from February&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, yet more snippets about Browserflow and Roam Research, machine learning research, PLG and other online learning ideas, and pandemic coping are all on my list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I sat down today to pen a snippet, I initially thought I would write about my ideas for using virtual reality table tennis for group coaching sessions. It felt funny though; I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure why I was writing it. Was snippets a place to collect good ideas I may want to share with people in the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This snippet is me taking a moment to reflect on why I write snippets, to reload my old reasoning back into memory, and to see if it still makes sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a few early reasons. Learning to communicate was a big one early on. Avoiding the addicting nature of social media was part of why I chose to write here, rather than on another platform. Feeling like I was writing for no audience, and the freedoms and desires that I found came with that, was a bigger reason for continuing on this platform rather than another. All of these continue to ring true, though there is one key way in which my writing deviates from its stated purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I set out to get better at communicating, one of my motivations was for communicating research. I&amp;rsquo;ve hardly written about my research at all! I don&amp;rsquo;t want to make a big change here; I like the type of topic I tend to select for snippets, and I like the expectation that I&amp;rsquo;ve set for myself that I can write about anything, with the bar set extremely low. That said, I will make a small mental adjustment, and add to my internal Potential Topics List writing about my published research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with this snippet, I hope and intend that I am resuming somewhat more frequent writing. This is a non-promise, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-08-biking-in-the-morning/&#34;&gt;a mere &amp;ldquo;aspirational intent&amp;rdquo; like the one I made about biking back in October&lt;/a&gt;. That one worked out though; I continued biking regularly well into the cold season, so I&amp;rsquo;m optimistic that this one will pan out positively as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Margin notes</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-23-margin-notes/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 23 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-23-margin-notes/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to add margin notes to my website.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;d also like to learn how to use Fiverr.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
So, I&amp;rsquo;m going to hire someone on Fiverr to add margin notes on my website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fabian, over at capnfabs.net, has an 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://capnfabs.net/posts/margin-notes-hugo-theme/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;excellent post&lt;/a&gt; where he adds margin notes to his own hugo blog. We&amp;rsquo;ll be using that for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my Fiverr experience I&amp;rsquo;ll update this snippet or add a new one, ideally one full of margin notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update (same day): I&amp;rsquo;m back! I didn&amp;rsquo;t use Fiverr. I used the post on capnfabs for reference and set up margin notes myself. Thank you Fabian for documenting your process.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ll have to learn to use Fiverr another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m glad to have this working. There&amp;rsquo;s room to improve the style though. Perhaps in a future iteration I&amp;rsquo;ll move the main content left to give more space for the margin notes, or make some changes to the font and size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like this to be a margin note. At the time of this writing, it&amp;rsquo;s a footnote. &lt;em&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt;: Now it&amp;rsquo;s a margin note! At least if your browser is wide enough&amp;hellip; otherwise it&amp;rsquo;s still a footnote. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve used it twice before, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a great experience with the one programmer I hired. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, it is greatly appreciated! 🙏 &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Will it be harder to write snippets now?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/post/2021-01-08-where-are-all-the-posts-from-2020/&#34;&gt;linked to the snippets section from my main website&lt;/a&gt;, will it be harder to write snippets? I hope not. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to make an even more concerted effort to lower the quality bar though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal, as always, is for the snippets section to avoid any inhibitions. Writing here should be as easy as thinking aloud. A tiny post like this ought to help in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/post/2021-01-08-where-are-all-the-posts-from-2020/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll notice I have no 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/posts/&#34;&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt; from 2020, but this is not because I stopped writing. Instead, I have been writing &amp;ldquo;snippets,&amp;rdquo; which 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/&#34;&gt;you can read here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re going to read just one snippet, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2019-12-30-writing-for-no-audience/&#34;&gt;I recommend that it be this one&lt;/a&gt;.
The main idea behind snippets is to allow me to write without the inhibitions I sometimes experience when writing a blog post for publication.
By writing in a secluded section of the website with no (now, few) inbound links, and by deliberately keeping the quality bar for publication low to non-existent, I made it easier for myself to write often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep the quality bar low,
sometimes I would deliberately post a short half-baked thought, possibly without editing or revision.
Despite this aim of keeping the quality bar low, and despite explicitly writing for no one, I often would find myself pleased with what I had written and eager for someone else to read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, this is the beauty of the setup. The (lack of) quality standards make &lt;em&gt;starting writing&lt;/em&gt; easy. I typically start writing a snippet with the mindset that I have a little idea I want to get out of my head and onto paper. As I begin, I think it&amp;rsquo;s a small idea that will take just a few lines. Perhaps in the back of my mind I even think it will contribute to lowering of the quality-bar for the section of the website. And sometimes it does. But just as often, I find myself ready to elaborate on the idea. Perhaps I explain where the idea came from, or why I find it interesting. And by the time I&amp;rsquo;ve finished writing, I have a snippet that I&amp;rsquo;m proud of, and which I would love to discuss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I sometimes put my email address at the end of a snippet. With just a cursory description of the snippets section (&amp;ldquo;a place to write for no audience&amp;rdquo;), seeing my contact info at the end of a post may feel contradictory. Now you see that it is not; the lack of a quality bar and the lack of an audience serve their purpose in allowing me to start writing easily, and to publish readily, but once I have written something and released it to (a tiny unlinked corner of) the world I do not necessarily want to keep it hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I am now for the first time linking from my main website 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/&#34;&gt;directly to the snippets section of my website&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s not a prominent link, as it&amp;rsquo;s contained only within this blog post, but it&amp;rsquo;s a meaningful step for me. Web crawlers now have a means in to index the site. Visitors to the site now have a means in too, not just people to whom I explicitly send the link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do venture in, and read a snippet or two, there are a few things to know.
First, you&amp;rsquo;re welcome here. It&amp;rsquo;s not voyeurism. These aren&amp;rsquo;t private posts; they&amp;rsquo;re simply not written for an audience, but I am happy for them to have one. Second, they&amp;rsquo;re snippets. Think of them like ideas scrawled in a hurry. I&amp;rsquo;m not wedded to the ideas I express, and I&amp;rsquo;m open to reconsidering what I wrote. And thirdly, I value your thoughts (and your time!), and it would delight me to hear them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll find ideas for side-projects, philosophical musings, technical notes meant mainly for future-me, technical notes meant for other people, project updates, nonsense, personal notes, and more. All of this, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Publishing Blog Posts from Roam Research Quickly and Automatically</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-28-publishing-blog-posts-from-roam-research-quickly-and-automatically/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-28-publishing-blog-posts-from-roam-research-quickly-and-automatically/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought today I would attempt a proper treatment of my latest automatic &amp;ldquo;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/&#34;&gt;snippet&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; publishing system. It uses JavaScript embedded directly in Roam Research to publish snippets to my website with low latency as I write them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prior-methods&#34;&gt;Prior methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously I&amp;rsquo;ve written a system to allow 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-09-27-posting-snippets-from-my-phone/&#34;&gt;Bieber Bot to publish snippets that I send him&lt;/a&gt;, and followed that up with a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-06-introducing-the-snippet-queue/&#34;&gt;snippet queue&lt;/a&gt; to allow me to schedule the publication of my snippets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve then also implemented two previous automatic snippet publishers from Roam. The first used my roam-to-git backup to detect new or updated snippets. The second used a puppeteer instance to occasionally check Roam for new or updated snippets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That makes this my third implementation of automatic snippet publishing from Roam, and my fifth automatic snippet publishing project to date. It&amp;rsquo;s the fastest yet, going from Roam to live on the website in just 90 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;room-for-improvement&#34;&gt;Room for improvement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why was publishing through Bieber Bot not enough? Roam is a natural place to write, and I find I write quite a bit more here than I do elsewhere. Since snippets are 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2019-12-30-writing-for-no-audience/&#34;&gt;all about lowering the barrier of entry to writing&lt;/a&gt;, supporting writing snippets in Roam seems natural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why was the roam-to-git backup based automatic publication system insufficient? While, adequate, the latency between writing a snippet and having it show up on my website was multiple hours. The roam-to-git backups only trigger every hour, and fail about 30% of the time. The script to use those backups to publish to my website would also only run every hour. Their combined schedules meant it could be 2-3 or more hours between writing a snippet and being able to share the link to it. Lowering this latency would give me more freedom to quickly write and share snippets, and also to iterate on a published snippet. Fast iteration is powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, why was the puppeteer-based approach insufficient. While this approach had the potential to bring the publication latency down considerably, in practice I scheduled in to run about hourly, since a headless browser is a computationally heavy piece of software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-new-approach-roamjs&#34;&gt;The new approach: &amp;ldquo;roam/js&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roam Research allows you to write JavaScript to run directly in Roam. My new approach is to run JavaScript in Roam to detect when a new snippet is written or when an existing snippet gets updated. When this occurs, the script will trigger a GitHub Action, using the snippet content and metadata as input. The GitHub Action will commit the snippet to my website&amp;rsquo;s git repo, and trigger a rebuilding of my website. It does everything except the final deploy to the webserver automatically; that final step waits for me to send a message &amp;ldquo;Deploy snippets!&amp;rdquo; to Bieber Bot, upon receipt of which the final deploy step is performed and the website is updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this approach it takes only 90 seconds between writing or editing a snippet and having it live on my website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;detecting-new-snippets-and-snippet-updates&#34;&gt;Detecting new snippets and snippet updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two key pieces to how I detect new and updated snippets. The first is a &amp;ldquo;mutation observer&amp;rdquo;. A mutation observer is an object in JavaScript that allows you to schedule events to occur when DOM changes are made to a website. In Roam, the DOM is modified when the user makes edits, and so DOM changes can indicate that the user has made a change to their notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to detect when a snippet is created or edited. So, we write a function that detects if a snippet has been created or edited since the last time it was called, and we use a mutation observer to call this function when the DOM changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since DOM changes can occur very frequently in Roam, we use a technique called 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidwalsh.name/javascript-debounce-function&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;debouncing&lt;/a&gt; to limit the number of calls to this detection function during periods of many consecutive DOM changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we detect if a snippet has been created or edited? Roam Research provides a datalog API that allows us to query our entire Roam graph using a logic programming language. You can 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-22-datalog-queries-for-roam-research/&#34;&gt;learn more about how this works here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mark a snippet for publication by tagging it with both the &amp;ldquo;Snippets&amp;rdquo; tag, and the &amp;ldquo;ok-to-publish&amp;rdquo; tag. This query detects those blocks that are part of a publishable snippet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;ancestor = `[ 
 [(ancestor ?child ?parent) 
  [?parent :block/children ?child]] 
 [(ancestor ?child ?ancestor) 
  [?parent :block/children ?child] 
  (ancestor ?parent ?ancestor)]]
]`;

block_info = window.roamAlphaAPI.q(`[
  :find ?uid ?child_text ?child_uid ?parent_uid ?order
  :in $ %
  :where
  [?block :block/uid ?uid]
  [?block :block/string ?string]
  [?block :block/refs ?snippets]
  [?block :block/refs ?publish]
  [?snippets :node/title &amp;quot;Snippets&amp;quot;]
  [?publish :node/title &amp;quot;ok-to-publish&amp;quot;]
  (ancestor ?child ?block)
  [?parent :block/children ?child]
  [?parent :block/uid ?parent_uid]
  [?child :block/uid ?child_uid]
  [?child :block/order ?order]
  [?child :block/string ?child_text]
]`, ancestor);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s break down what&amp;rsquo;s happening in this query. First, there&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;code&gt;ancestor&lt;/code&gt; rule. The Roam datalog schema only includes a blocks immediate children; the &lt;code&gt;ancestor&lt;/code&gt; rule allows us to query for all a block&amp;rsquo;s descendants or ancestors, not just the immediate ones. It does this through the recursive definition of &amp;ldquo;ancestor&amp;rdquo; shown, which you can read as &amp;ldquo;An ancestor of ?child is ?parent if ?parent has a child ?child, AND ALSO an ancestor of ?child is ?ancestor if there exists some ?parent satisfying both ?parent has a child ?child, and ?parent has ?ancestor as an ancestor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the query (lines 10-24) finds blocks that are the descendants of a block ?block that&amp;rsquo;s tagged with both &amp;ldquo;Snippets&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;ok-to-publish.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Datalog returns the results in an arbitrary order, we need to use the :block/order attribute to reconstruct the proper order of the blocks that comprise the snippet. The logic for this isn&amp;rsquo;t shown, but don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to reach out if this interests you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, our mutation observer keeps track of the text of each of the snippets, and if any of them change or if a new snippet is introduced, it triggers a GitHub Action to deploy the snippet to my website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;writing-a-github-action-to-update-my-website&#34;&gt;Writing a GitHub Action to update my website&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My website uses a static site generator, Hugo. So, updating my website consists of adding a markdown file to 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dbieber/davidbieber.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;its GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;, rebuilding the site by running Hugo, and then pushing the generated static files up to my server. All of these steps can be automated in a GitHub action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;triggering-a-github-action-from-roam-research&#34;&gt;Triggering a GitHub Action from Roam Research&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To trigger a GitHub Action from Roam Research, I set up the action to trigger on &amp;ldquo;repository_dispatch&amp;rdquo; events. I created a personal authentication token, and then use the following JavaScript to trigger the GitHub Action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;function publishSnippetRaw(uid, title, date, content) {
  const data = {
    &amp;quot;event_type&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;snippet-update&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;client_payload&amp;quot;: {
      &amp;quot;uid&amp;quot;: uid,
      &amp;quot;title&amp;quot;: title,
      &amp;quot;date&amp;quot;: date,
      &amp;quot;content&amp;quot;: content,
    }
  };
  fetch(
    &amp;quot;https://api.github.com/repos/dbieber/davidbieber.com/dispatches&amp;quot;,
    {
      headers: {
        Accept: &amp;quot;application/vnd.github.everest-preview+json&amp;quot;,
        Authorization: &amp;quot;token PERSONAL_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN&amp;quot;,
      },
      method: &#39;POST&#39;,
      body: JSON.stringify(data),
    }
  );
}
const publishSnippet = debounce(publishSnippetRaw, 15000, true);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This call to &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt; starts the GitHub Action running on a GitHub server within seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;accepting-inputs-in-a-github-action&#34;&gt;Accepting inputs in a GitHub Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will notice that &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; contains a &amp;ldquo;client_payload&amp;rdquo; in the above JavaScript. To accept inputs in the GitHub Action, I access the data from the client_payload and set it to an environment variable in the Action YAML like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34;&gt;env:
  SNIPPET_UID: ${{ github.event.client_payload.uid }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environment variables like this can then be used by the steps in the action. This allows me to pass the contents of the new/modified snippet to the GitHub Action, which is everything needed for automating its publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GitHub Action writes the markdown file, commits it to the repository, runs hugo to regenerate the static files for the website, and commits those to the appropriate part of the repo as well. The only step remaining at this point is pushing the new files up to my server to serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;deploying-with-ansible&#34;&gt;Deploying with Ansible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ansible.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ansible&lt;/a&gt; to deploy my website to its lone server. 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/bieber-bot/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Bieber Bot&lt;/a&gt; is also quite capable of using Ansible. So, we have an arrangement where I tell Bieber Bot when to redeploy my website, and he does so for me. This way I can deploy my website even when I&amp;rsquo;m on the go and not at a computer; I just message him using my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All steps, from the last keystroke of writing a snippet to having it show up live on my website, together take about 90 seconds. This is a significant quality-of-life improvement over the multi-hour latency of just a few days ago. I&amp;rsquo;m hopeful that the result is I&amp;rsquo;ll write even more.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Even Faster Snippet Publishing from Roam</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-27-even-faster-snippet-publishing-from-roam/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 27 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-27-even-faster-snippet-publishing-from-roam/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve set up a GitHub action to enable even faster automatic publishing of snippets from Roam. This is a test-snippet I&amp;rsquo;m using while writing the auto-publisher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see how it behaves if I&amp;rsquo;m editing an existing snippet routinely for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it works as intended, the snippet will update itself on GitHub after I stop typing for several seconds. I&amp;rsquo;ve now stopped typing, we&amp;rsquo;ll see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It worked! 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dbieber/davidbieber.com/commit/1f1ad4680e1d538f699cf2cd420f0c04a4bf528a&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the commit&lt;/a&gt; that was made automatically after I finished the previous sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will make publishing snippets &lt;strong&gt;even easier&lt;/strong&gt; going forward. It also means I don&amp;rsquo;t need to keep a puppeteer instance constantly live with Roam open like I&amp;rsquo;d originally planned for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total latency from writing to publication is now just 90 seconds. So you could be reading this mere minutes after I write it!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Improving Roam Snippet Publishing Speeds</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-23-improving-roam-snippet-publishing-speeds/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-23-improving-roam-snippet-publishing-speeds/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey folks, I have a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/bieber-bot/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;workflow&lt;/a&gt; for automatically publishing &amp;ldquo;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2019-12-30-writing-for-no-audience/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;snippets&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; to my website from Roam. Currently there&amp;rsquo;s a multi-hour latency between writing a snippet and when it appears on my website. In this snippet I&amp;rsquo;m going to muse about / ask questions about how to use &lt;strong&gt;puppeteer&lt;/strong&gt; to bring this latency down considerably. This&amp;rsquo;ll be my first time using puppeteer, so help appreciated. Read on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/10.2/apple-small/1f62e@2x.png&#34; alt=&#34;😮&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current system relies on my git-to-roam backup, which runs every hour and fails some fraction of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to bring the latency down, the idea is to use pyppeteer (the python puppeteer bindings) to log into Roam in a headless browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will monitor Roam for new (or modified) snippets, and will publish them to my website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A snippet is OK to publish if its tagged with both &amp;ldquo;Snippets&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;ok-to-publish&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, first question: has anyone done this before? B/c if someone&amp;rsquo;s already gotten all the CSS/XPATH selectors for logging in, navigating, etc, that could save me some time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important thing I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about: are there problems keeping an instance of Roam open in a headless browser could cause?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E.g. I hear about occasional data loss which seems related to having out-of-date instances of Roam open on other machines &amp;ndash; e.g. maybe the out of date Roam comes back online and overwrites new content with older blank content?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;rsquo;ll make my headless Roam instances relatively-short lived (&amp;lt;10 minutes) just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the strategy I&amp;rsquo;ll take will be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log in to Roam in headless browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run datalog query in javascript to check for new/updated snippets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run that query fairly frequently (e.g. every few seconds) in order to detect snippets as soon as they&amp;rsquo;re available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debounce, so that if a snippet is actively changing its only deployed ~twice, not 100 times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then every 10 minutes or so I&amp;rsquo;ll have it take a short breather and refresh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abhay suggested using the alpha API for this rather than puppeteering. &lt;img src=&#34;https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/10.2/apple-medium/1f64f@2x.png&#34; alt=&#34;🙏&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;rsquo;ll get started on the puppeteer implementation now though anyway, even if the API ends up being a better way of doing this in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a first draft that handles log in and running the query to detect publishable material (blocks with the appropriate two tags).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure how reliable login is as I had some hiccups getting it working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the headless browser seems very slow to notice changes to the Roam graph compared to what I&amp;rsquo;m used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead of checking every few seconds, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll just check once a minute or so, refreshing either every time or every few times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unexpected snag: I get the children of a block but I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to put them in the proper order!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(with datalog)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could navigate to the block and look at the dom&amp;hellip; but hopefully I don&amp;rsquo;t need to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks like there is an &amp;ldquo;order&amp;rdquo; attribute, so this will be doable. Might be messy though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;rsquo;m understanding right, :block/order gives the index of a block into its parents children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re good! &lt;img src=&#34;https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/10.2/apple-medium/1f44d@2x.png&#34; alt=&#34;👍&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this on my website, it worked!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Looking back on my browsing history snippets</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-20-looking-back-on-my-browsing-history-snippets/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 20 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-12-20-looking-back-on-my-browsing-history-snippets/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve now written several snippets about my analyzing my browsing history programmatically. I figured I&amp;rsquo;d collect them all in one place here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2019-12-30-analyzing-my-browser-history/&#34;&gt;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2019-12-30-analyzing-my-browser-history/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presumably as I write more about this, the list will go out of date. And that&amp;rsquo;s alright. This is just a snippet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This motivates me to move all my snippets into Roam Research. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to do this just yet, but it seems a decent idea. Backlinks/tags would then allow for easily keeping an up-to-date list of all the snippets I&amp;rsquo;ve written about various topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back on these many browsing history snippets, what themes stand out? Browser histories are rich with information about our lives. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot we can do to make our lives better using that information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can detect if we&amp;rsquo;re getting distracted, and have automated interventions if we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can figure out our interests, and notice if they&amp;rsquo;re drifting over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can reflect on things we&amp;rsquo;ve learned or thought about in the past, revisiting our old ideas. This can help generate new ideas, and also strengthen our memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve made some progress on automated distraction detection. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to write a snippet about that soon. I&amp;rsquo;ve also recently poked at getting my browsing history from my phone on my computer, so that can be analyzed in near real-time too. This promises to make distraction detection even more compelling. Very excited to teach Bieber Bot how to stage a distraction intervention some time in the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Publishing Through Roam Research</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-11-24-publishing-through-roam-research/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-11-24-publishing-through-roam-research/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With this snippet I&amp;rsquo;m testing out a new snippet publishing system: publishing snippets directly from Roam Research. Using the system is simple: I simply tag any bullet with &amp;ldquo;ok-to-publish&amp;rdquo; and Bieber Bot publishes it and its children as a snippet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why another way of writing snippets? I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing quite a bit in Roam lately but I haven&amp;rsquo;t been publishing snippets lately. In truth, this new publishing mechanism is more a novelty than something practically useful. It would be easy enough to copy a snippet out of Roam into a text editor or to Bieber Bot in Facebook Messenger to publish it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It certainly is appealing to be able to publish directly in Roam where I spend a lot of my time writing though. I think being able to publish directly from Roam may appeal to many other people as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The place where it may save time is in making changes to snippets. If I write a snippet in Roam today and publish it in the usual way, any changes I make it Roam aren’t reflected in the published version. Under this new system the copy on my website can automatically be updated to match the copy in Roam whenever I make changes there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;ve marked this snippet as ok-to-publish, so once I build the system this should show up on my website. If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this there, it worked!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extracting Snippets from Roam Research</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-11-03-extracting-snippets-from-roam-research/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Nov 2020 15:22:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-11-03-extracting-snippets-from-roam-research/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing a lot these days inside of Roam Research. I wonder if there&amp;rsquo;s a good way to identify snippet-quality items from within my Roam database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One option would be to pick out decent-sized sections of continuous text.
If I&amp;rsquo;m taking notes in a bunch of different areas, that&amp;rsquo;s probably not well suited for publishing as a snippet unless I were to clean it up first.
But if I see there&amp;rsquo;s a large chunk of text that&amp;rsquo;s been added in a contiguous block, there&amp;rsquo;s a decent chance that its snippet-quality.
&amp;ldquo;Snippet-quality&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t a particularly high bar. The bar is really just that we&amp;rsquo;d want text that forms a coherent thought rather than being a few lines on totally unrelated thoughts (which can also appear contiguously in Roam).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I set up Roam-to-Git, so every hour my Roam database is backed up to a private GitHub repository. It would be easy enough to look through the git diffs to see if there&amp;rsquo;s something that fits this description.
One possible issue with this though is that the backup script doesn&amp;rsquo;t know if I&amp;rsquo;m in the middle of writing. So it&amp;rsquo;s possible it will catch me mid-snippet.
Perhaps if I look at the diff between head and two commits back, I can avoid missing snippets that got split over multiple commits. It&amp;rsquo;s an idea worth looking in to, though the number of false positives might be too high without a fair amount of tuning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introducing the Snippet Queue</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-06-introducing-the-snippet-queue/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 22:16:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-06-introducing-the-snippet-queue/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my first snippet published using my 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-06-further-reducing-the-publication-barrier-with-queuing/&#34;&gt;snippet queue idea&lt;/a&gt;. If all goes well, it will be (read: was) published tomorrow evening (October 7, 2020).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system works like this. I store a queue of snippets in Redis. Each snippet has the title, content, and date associated with it, as well as an id number. I can have Bieber Bot enqueue a new snippet by messaging him with &amp;ldquo;Queue snippet!&amp;rdquo; and the snippet details. He also responds to queries to update, view, or remove an existing snippet, or to view the current queue of snippets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, every evening Bieber Bot looks at the oldest item in the queue. If he&amp;rsquo;s already asked me about it, and I haven&amp;rsquo;t told him not to publish it, he goes and publishes it to my website. If he hasn&amp;rsquo;t asked me about it yet, he asks me if its OK to publish. As long as I don&amp;rsquo;t say no and remove the snippet from the queue, Bieber Bot will go forward with publishing the snippet the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Further Reducing the Publication Barrier with Queuing</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-06-further-reducing-the-publication-barrier-with-queuing/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 13:29:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-06-further-reducing-the-publication-barrier-with-queuing/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is the barrier to publication? It&amp;rsquo;s first and foremost a mental barrier. Sure, the act of writing presents its own challenges, but for me the mental hurdle of clicking send can be significant. Snippets lowers the barrier substantially compared with social media, messaging individuals, or even traditional blogging. Still, there&amp;rsquo;s room to lower the barrier even more; e.g. private journaling and &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt; itself have much lower barriers than Snippets does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea today for lowering the barrier is a publication queue. In this idea, I write a snippet, send it to Bieber Bot, and he holds on to it for a bit. Then, after a day or so, he lets me know that he&amp;rsquo;s going to publish it soon. He gives me an opportunity to tell him not to publish it, but after some time has passed, he goes ahead and publishes it in my Snippets section on my behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During that waiting period, I can send Bieber Bot revised versions of the Snippet, which will supersede the original. This way, when I send Bieber Bot the original snippet, I do so knowing that it will only be published as is if 1) I don&amp;rsquo;t come up with a way to improve it and 2) I don&amp;rsquo;t decide not to publish it. This takes a bit of the decision making burden off of present-David, and gives it to future-David. Between the two of them, they should be able to handle the publication no problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea acts similarly to GMail&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;send later&amp;rdquo; feature, but without the need to choose a send time. Clicking &amp;ldquo;send later&amp;rdquo; is easier than clicking &amp;ldquo;send&amp;rdquo; because there&amp;rsquo;s an opportunity to undo or make changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to decreasing the barrier to publication, one thing I like about this idea is that it gives me an opportunity to revisit old ideas. When Bieber Bot tells me &amp;ldquo;Hey, last chance to rescind publication of this Snippet&amp;rdquo; that gives me an opportunity to reflect on what I&amp;rsquo;d written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also like that it can spread out the publication of snippets that I write in a single sitting. Currently, after publishing a single snippet, I&amp;rsquo;m not inclined to write more because I would feel funny publishing multiple snippets in quick succession (another mental barrier to climb over, I suppose). If I knew that Bieber Bot would take care of spacing out the publications, I might feel more comfortable writing a second or third snippet in a single sitting. I&amp;rsquo;d like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, a publication queue it is! This shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too much effort to implement given the work I&amp;rsquo;ve already done to support snippet publications, scheduling, question-asking, and messaging in Bieber Bot.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Snippets I Don&#39;t Publish</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-06-the-snippets-i-dont-publish/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 12:33:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-06-the-snippets-i-dont-publish/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of Snippets is to minimize the barrier to writing as much as possible. To this end, it has been very effective. Still, there are several snippets that I write and do not publish, despite my self-insistence that the barrier to publication be minimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What don&amp;rsquo;t I publish, and why? Looking over my recent unpublished snippets, some themes appear. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I don&amp;rsquo;t tend to publish:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work related snippets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideas that trail off mid thought&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Status update + planning snippets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend not to post work related snippets just to be on the safe side with respect to Google confidentiality, though I&amp;rsquo;m confident the snippets I&amp;rsquo;m writing would be OK to publish if I requested permission to do so (of course, that would raise the barrier to publishing significantly which defeats the purpose of snippets.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has a cascading effect though, because now when I write a status update or planning snippet, it references things I&amp;rsquo;ve written in unpublished snippets. Such a snippet wouldn&amp;rsquo;t stand alone effectively. I suppose that&amp;rsquo;s not such a problem though; if I ever post a snippet mentioning in-progress projects, feel free to ask me about them, or feel free to ignore. The main audience of the snippet is probably me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In brief, the recent snippets I did not publish are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A follow up to the &amp;ldquo;Infinite Distractions&amp;rdquo; plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Considering discrete vs fuzzy decision making&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several activities I&amp;rsquo;d like to do more of, and strategies to help me to do them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A plan for biking the next day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An idea for how to teach Bieber Bot to ask and answer questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflecting, work planning, and more Bieber Bot interaction planning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some reflecting and daily planning (half work-related) from yesterday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 4-line idea for queuing publication of snippets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll put a few of these up. I would, after all, like to get better at communicating publicly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Phone Snippets (A Test Phone Snippet)</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-09-27-why-phone-snippets-a-test-phone-snippet/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why do I want to be able to post snippets from my phone?
I enjoy hiking or biking somewhere pleasant, bringing a pocket-sized Bluetooth keyboard, and writing on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re seeing this snippet (which you are), that means not only does posting snippets through Bieber Bot work, editing them though Bieber Bot does too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Posting Snippets from My Phone</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-09-27-posting-snippets-from-my-phone/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 27 Sep 2020 16:32:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-09-27-posting-snippets-from-my-phone/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to be able to post snippets from my phone.
As I&amp;rsquo;ve stated before, the purpose of the snippets section of my website is to lower the barrier to me publishing as much as possible.
Being able to post a snippet from my phone would help in this respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem so hard to set up, especially now that Bieber Bot runs continuously on my laptop.
I could have Bieber Bot listen for a message like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-md&#34;&gt;Snippet!
Posting Snippets from My Phone
I&#39;d like to be able to post...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he receives such a message, what should he do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new file with the appropriate front matter and content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commit that file and push it to GitHub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the ansible update script.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it. This MVP should be relatively easy to get up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: It is indeed up and running now. I wrote this snippet on my phone :).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ask Me Anywhere</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-01-25-ask-me-anywhere/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2020 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-01-25-ask-me-anywhere/</guid>
      
        <message>In this post you can ask a question at _any_ point.</message>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With this post, I&amp;rsquo;m demoing a new work-in-progress feature for my blog called &amp;ldquo;Ask Me Anywhere&amp;rdquo;.
The feature lets you leave a comment or ask a question at &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; point while reading my writing.
The goal is to encourage readers to respond to my writing, because I&amp;rsquo;m interested in having a conversation and hearing what you have to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can try it right now. Either &lt;strong&gt;double click&lt;/strong&gt; (double-tap on mobile) on any paragraph, or click between two paragraphs, to open a comment box. Enter your thoughts, click submit, and &lt;em&gt;voila!&lt;/em&gt;, comment submitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re welcome to enter your email address, name, Twitter handle, Facebook ID, or any other form of contact info if you&amp;rsquo;d like me to respond. And if you do, there is high likelihood that I will respond. If you don&amp;rsquo;t, you&amp;rsquo;re anonymous, and you certainly won&amp;rsquo;t receive a private response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments and questions that you submit are not posted publicly anywhere. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a comments section for public discussion. If you want to discuss my posts publicly, submit them on Hacker News or Reddit, or head to Twitter to engage. While this website isn&amp;rsquo;t the place for public discussions&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, I am curious to know about such a discussion if it&amp;rsquo;s happening. So, feel free to let me know about such a discussion via &amp;ldquo;AMA&amp;rdquo; if you&amp;rsquo;re starting one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens when you leave a comment? This part&amp;rsquo;s still a work in progress, but ideally my digital personal assistant 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/bieber-bot&#34;&gt;Bieber Bot&lt;/a&gt; will notify me of the new comment at the next convenient time. If there are many comments coming in, Bieber Bot will try to be smart about batching the notifications together, and so the notification may be delayed, but I&amp;rsquo;ll soon read your message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, Ask Me Anywhere is only activated for this one post. Once I&amp;rsquo;ve tested it out a bit, and perhaps made some changes, I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to then activate it for the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/posts&#34;&gt;rest of my posts&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets&#34;&gt;and snippets&lt;/a&gt; as well. So I&amp;rsquo;m particularly keen to get feedback early so I can iterate and improve it soon. Give it a try, let me know what you think. You know how to reach me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in learning more about the internals, the source is 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dbieber/davidbieber.com/blob/772b5dd87da532357a1cdf04a8caa027268bfbac/hugo/assets/js-src/ask-me-anywhere.jsx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;available on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. Feel free to have a poke around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name of the project &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Ask Me Anywhere&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; reflects my intention to enable readers to ask questions as they&amp;rsquo;re reading. However, I welcome all types of reactions: questions, comments, feedback, corrections, new ideas, etc. I look forward to hearing what you have to say.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Writing for No Audience</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2019-12-30-writing-for-no-audience/</link>

        <message>Writing for no one is so much easier than writing for someone.</message>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started this 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;snippets&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; section of my website just a few days ago with the intention of being able to write without needing to put polish on a piece before publishing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thinking was that I would be able to put small notes there, and half-baked ideas, and not have to worry about diluting the quality of the content of my 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/posts&#34;&gt;main website&lt;/a&gt;. I could put high quality posts on the main site, and a whole range of both good and bad posts in the snippets section. This way, assuming I do a good job, readers could come to expect that any post on the main website would be high quality. Curious people looking for additional content could come here to the snippets section if they wanted to, but more often posts here would either (1) almost never get read, or (2) be linked to directly, e.g. if they were relevent in some other context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been surprised and delighted by the effect that having this &amp;ldquo;No Audience&amp;rdquo; section of the website has had on my writing. Writing for no one is so much easier than writing for someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a few occasions (and it&amp;rsquo;s only been a few days since I started this section), I&amp;rsquo;ve started writing snippets intending for them to be brief thoughts meant for no one but myself. Then, after starting, it has felt natural to expand the post into something more substantial than I originally intended, e.g. answering questions that a hypothetical reader might have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/post/2019-12-29-track-your-life-in-a-spreadsheet&#34;&gt;occasion&lt;/a&gt; I even decided to bump the post up in importance after getting started, placing it in the main section of the website rather than relegating it to the mostly hidden snippets section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To anyone out there who does end up reading this, and there may very well be none of you: if you&amp;rsquo;re having trouble getting started with writing, write for no audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-different-degrees-of-no-audience&#34;&gt;The Different Degrees of &amp;ldquo;No Audience&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually write for No Audience in two different contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) The 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets&#34;&gt;snippets&lt;/a&gt; section of my website&lt;br&gt;
(2) Using 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/shh-shell&#34;&gt;shh-shell&lt;/a&gt; at night&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The snippets section of my website is public, but with no built-in broadcasting. People can read it if they choose to, but I&amp;rsquo;m not putting it in people&amp;rsquo;s faces (by default; I will if it&amp;rsquo;s appropriate in context). Contrast this with the writing I do with the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/shh-shell&#34;&gt;shh-shell&lt;/a&gt;. This is more personal writing that I do half-asleep as I drift off at night, and so I don&amp;rsquo;t make it public; I expect almost no one will ever read it. This writing, I suppose is for No Audience to an even more extreme degree. I recommend both practices: public writing for no audience, and private writing for no audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;social-media-doesnt-cut-it&#34;&gt;Social Media Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Cut It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered this practice and am quite fond of it, I think it could be a promising addition to social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No social media platform, to my knowledge, has given people a place to write public posts with an option to publish but not share them. The absense of such a feature makes sense; social media platforms need you to share for them to succeed, so how would giving you a space to publish-but-not-share help them? The answer lies in the psychology of the many social-media lurkers. There is a significant market segment of people who perhaps consume, but do not post, on social media. An option to publish-but-not-broadcast might help to convert some of that segment into sharers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a social media consumer, but infrequent producer, I can tell you I am hesitant even to Like something on Twitter, because I know Twitter often treats Likes like Retweets, and will put the content I hearted in front of my followers with my name attached, and that&amp;rsquo;s not something I want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a feature for publishing-without-sharing were added to Facebook or Twitter, perhaps others would have an experience like mine over the last few days. Having the option to publish-but-not-share has significantly reduced the barrier to start writing for me. Then, once I&amp;rsquo;ve started writing, I&amp;rsquo;ve often changed my mind and decided I want to share what I&amp;rsquo;ve written after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If other social-media lurkers are like me, a feature enabling this behavior could help &amp;ldquo;break the ice&amp;rdquo; so to speak, and could make social media platforms more relevant to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;next-steps&#34;&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to continue building this snippets section for myself, with the default behavior being no-broadcasting as I add snippets. For snippets I&amp;rsquo;m fond of, I may choose to broadcast (e.g. by posting about the post on social media). Contrast this with the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/posts&#34;&gt;main posts section&lt;/a&gt; of my website; for new posts there, I will generally always broadcast the post, at least a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;d like to receive such broadcasts, e.g. when I write a post that I&amp;rsquo;m particularly keen on sharing, please consider subscribing:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learning to Communicate</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2019-12-26-learning-to-communicate/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2019-12-26-learning-to-communicate/</guid>
      
        <message>My goal for 2020 was to learn to communicate better with the world. Still a goal for me.</message>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My goal for 2020 is to learn to communicate better with the world. I work in a research group at Google, and our main job function is performing research in program synthesis. But research is only as valuable as how well it is communicated. So in 2020 I&amp;rsquo;d like to get better at communicating publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few options for doing this. The first is writing blog posts. This may be too large an undertaking to do frequently. I&amp;rsquo;d really like something that&amp;rsquo;s lower barrier to do, and with a lower quality bar, so that I can do this more often. The natural alternative with these properties is academic Twitter. However, I want to avoid the addictive nature of Twitter. I also want to write more than 280 characters at a time, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to put every little thing I write in front of people&amp;rsquo;s faces with equal importance. Twitter seems a good place for announcing a new paper or a Python Fire update, but not for sharing a musing like this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to start by silently posting my writings to my website, but in a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets&#34;&gt;separate section&lt;/a&gt; from the main blog. This way when there&amp;rsquo;s something with a little more polish that I think is explicitly worth reading, I can put it in the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/posts&#34;&gt;main blog section&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Bieber&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; about it, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to receive updates for every small writing I put up here, you can use this 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/index.xml&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to receive updates only for major posts, such as new publications or major life updates, you can use this 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/posts/index.xml&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; or you can subscribe here:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type=&#39;text/javascript&#39; src=&#39;//s3.amazonaws.com/downloads.mailchimp.com/js/mc-validate.js&#39;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy early new year!&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2019-12-25-introducing-snippets/</guid>
      
        <message>Back in 2019 I introduced the &#39;snippets&#39; section to my website. This was my first snippet.</message>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I&amp;rsquo;m introducing the &amp;ldquo;snippets&amp;rdquo; section of my website. The goal is to give myself a place to post content online that&amp;rsquo;s extremely easy to post to, but isn&amp;rsquo;t featured prominently anywhere on the site. This way I can post things without them needing polish or production value, but still link to them and share them as I see fit.&lt;/p&gt;
