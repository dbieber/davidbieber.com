      <title>Musical Aspirations</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2017 I picked up violin again, after a 15 year hiatus. I&amp;rsquo;d played throughout fourth grade, but then put the instrument down to focus on my studies.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m now plodding away at learning guitar and violin, and playing bits on the keyboard. It would be good to have some goals so I can direct my studies. One candidate goal based on my recent playing would be to produce You&amp;rsquo;ve Got a Friend in Me on all of these instruments: piano, violin, guitar, and I could even do vocals. I could record each of these separately and put them together in Ableton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing this on piano and violin seems well within reach. However, the number of new chords and speed of switching required to play it on guitar (at least from the arrangement I&amp;rsquo;ve seen so far) doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel super within reach right now. And as for the vocals&amp;hellip; well, I can at least get the words out, even if not the notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to the last time I thought about musical goals, I had some smaller ambitions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On piano, I wanted to be able to play all the scales&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On violin, You&amp;rsquo;ve Got a Friend in Me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And I hadn&amp;rsquo;t even started guitar yet..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, I&amp;rsquo;ve just checked and I&amp;rsquo;d misremembered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My violin goal from Dec 3 2022 was to play scales in every key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My piano goal was also to play scales in every key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And my guitar goal was to play the chords in House of the Rising Sun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think these goals still seem like proper first goals. So, by putting them in a snippet, perhaps I will encourage myself to pursue them more quickly. Then I can get to my You&amp;rsquo;ve Got a Friend In Me goals sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside: is that an instance of double sarcasm? I will have to dedicate a full snippet to double sarcasm at some point. In this instance, it&amp;rsquo;s meant to be a joke, but also might literaly be true&amp;hellip; Maybe not sarcasm but something in that vein. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Phone in the kitchen evaluation</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-08-22-phone-in-kitchen-eval/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 22 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-08-22-phone-in-kitchen-eval/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last month I decided to start keeping my phone in the kitchen while I&amp;rsquo;m in the house. I said I&amp;rsquo;d evaluate the decision after 6 weeks and decide whether to recommit. It&amp;rsquo;s been six weeks, and I think it was an excellent decision. I will absolutely continue doing this going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find I get more time in the mornings, because scrolling in bed or on the toilet isn&amp;rsquo;t really an option. Similarly in the evenings, scrolling in bed before going to sleep isn&amp;rsquo;t something I can do by accident. I do find I spend more time in the kitchen, in order to use my phone. So, I haven&amp;rsquo;t eliminated mindless scrolling altogether. My phone usage has decreased considerably overall though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oddest thing about it is that I don&amp;rsquo;t always have a way of knowing the itme when I wake up. I may want to put a non-phone clock in the bedroom to compensate for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes over the last six months I would find I accidentally would bring my phone with me to my desk. Usually this would happen after going out of the house for lunch (taking my phone with me). When I would return to the house, I would have my phone in my pocket, and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t always remember to put it in the kitchen. Once the phone reached my desk, sometimes I would then inadvertently scroll! Whenever I notice that I&amp;rsquo;ve brought my phone somewhere in the house outside the kitchen, it&amp;rsquo;s clear the right thing for me to do under this silly system I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen for myself, is to bring it back to the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be tempting to make only small violations to the rule, but I&amp;rsquo;ve realized it&amp;rsquo;s best not to fall for such temptations. There&amp;rsquo;s a bathroom just outside the kitchen, and I am tempted often to take the phone with me from the kitchen to the bathroom. I stop at the threshold to the kitchen, and do not cross if I&amp;rsquo;m holding my phone. Perhaps I stand in the threshold for a few minutes, finishing my phone usage before leaving. I put the phone down before exiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were to take the phone to the bathroom, I know what would happen. I would think, going in, that I will just use the phone for one particular purpose. However, as soon as I turn the screen on I would notice something that would put a different purpose into my mind. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a text message, or an app icon, or a notification. I think, switching tasks, that it&amp;rsquo;s a small diversion and I will momentarily return to the original purpose. However, moments later while completing the secondary task, my mental stack will erode, and the primary task will no longer be at the forefront of my brain. I&amp;rsquo;ll no longer be thinking about the one-and-done approach to phone usage, and now the potential for mindless scrolling has emerged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the phone stays in the kitchen. I will keep this rule for myself, at least as long as I live here in this house.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Keeping my phone in the kitchen</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-07-08-phone-in-kitchen/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to keep my phone in the kitchen while I&amp;rsquo;m in the house.
The goal is to reduce scrolling in the morning and evening, and prevent distractions more generally.
By keeping the phone in the kitchen, I&amp;rsquo;ll be unable to scroll mindlessly when I first wake up (unless of course I go to the kitchen to do so).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully by putting this intention up on my website, by having it in writing, by leaving it in a place where others could theoretically have read it, I am more likely to stick to this intention (both the spirit and the letter of it) for a longer period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I don&amp;rsquo;t yet know how this will go, or when I&amp;rsquo;ll first forget about it, I&amp;rsquo;ll pick a date now to check in on it. August 19, 2021. On August 19, 2021, six weeks from today, I&amp;rsquo;ll reevaluate this decision. If I like it, probably I will recommit to it for an additional period of time. If it wasn&amp;rsquo;t working for me, no harm done.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Resuming habits</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-06-17-a-torrent-of-snippets/&#34;&gt;Thursday&lt;/a&gt; I said I&amp;rsquo;d resume my “Snippets” and the “After Work Activities” habits today.
So, here I am, resuming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still aiming to sleep by 10:10 tonight though, so not too much to say right now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Resuming snippet writing?</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-17-resuming-snippet-writing/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-17-resuming-snippet-writing/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;About two month ago I encountered a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-21-snippets-dry-spell/&#34;&gt;snippets dry spell&lt;/a&gt;. At the time I didn&amp;rsquo;t foresee writing snippets at the same rate I had been leading up to that point. Sure enough, over the two months that followed I only wrote a handful of snippets. March saw two simultaneous Peer Learning Groups, and April lead into a period of intense virtual ping pong playing and lots of real-life hiking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wrapped up the Peer Learning Groups, a largely asynchronous low-commitment activity, with a virtual synchronous meet-up and coworking session. During these I produced these two snippets about what I learned for my PLG sessions: one on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-15-oil-pricing/&#34;&gt;Laser Eye Surgery&lt;/a&gt;, one on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-04-15-oil-pricing/&#34;&gt;Oil Pricing&lt;/a&gt;. I think this could be the trigger that brings me back into the pattern of writing snippets again, though I&amp;rsquo;m not certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting out to write snippets once more, I have a handful of half-baked ideas about what to write about: sleep, ping pong, virtual reality, hiking, the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-02-21-snippets-dry-spell/&#34;&gt;list of ideas from February&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, yet more snippets about Browserflow and Roam Research, machine learning research, PLG and other online learning ideas, and pandemic coping are all on my list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I sat down today to pen a snippet, I initially thought I would write about my ideas for using virtual reality table tennis for group coaching sessions. It felt funny though; I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure why I was writing it. Was snippets a place to collect good ideas I may want to share with people in the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This snippet is me taking a moment to reflect on why I write snippets, to reload my old reasoning back into memory, and to see if it still makes sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a few early reasons. Learning to communicate was a big one early on. Avoiding the addicting nature of social media was part of why I chose to write here, rather than on another platform. Feeling like I was writing for no audience, and the freedoms and desires that I found came with that, was a bigger reason for continuing on this platform rather than another. All of these continue to ring true, though there is one key way in which my writing deviates from its stated purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I set out to get better at communicating, one of my motivations was for communicating research. I&amp;rsquo;ve hardly written about my research at all! I don&amp;rsquo;t want to make a big change here; I like the type of topic I tend to select for snippets, and I like the expectation that I&amp;rsquo;ve set for myself that I can write about anything, with the bar set extremely low. That said, I will make a small mental adjustment, and add to my internal Potential Topics List writing about my published research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with this snippet, I hope and intend that I am resuming somewhat more frequent writing. This is a non-promise, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-08-biking-in-the-morning/&#34;&gt;a mere &amp;ldquo;aspirational intent&amp;rdquo; like the one I made about biking back in October&lt;/a&gt;. That one worked out though; I continued biking regularly well into the cold season, so I&amp;rsquo;m optimistic that this one will pan out positively as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crashing Facebook Japan, The “content sharing group”, 2021 goals, The “programmer’s apprentice”, Making decisions for 10,000 people, Roam Primitives: subscribe to changes, and Castles in the clouds (as a mental model for belief systems) &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Biking in the Morning</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-08-biking-in-the-morning/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Oct 2020 22:04:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-08-biking-in-the-morning/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some of the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-10-06-the-snippets-i-dont-publish/&#34;&gt;snippets I did not publish&lt;/a&gt; were about my plans for biking in the morning. For the last several days I&amp;rsquo;ve been biking to East Rock each morning, doing so before starting work on work days. I bring my pocket-sized keyboard and my phone, and when I&amp;rsquo;m at the top of the Rock I use my friend Jacob Cole&amp;rsquo;s app, ThoughtStream, to write about whatever&amp;rsquo;s on my mind. Sometimes this is a potential snippet, and sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s just planning for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like this routine but I&amp;rsquo;m not confident that I&amp;rsquo;ll continue it. Consistently getting up early for an extended period of time can be challenging, and I&amp;rsquo;m not inclined to set an alarm to help. Also, the weather is getting cooler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I certainly hope that I continue this routine, and I intend to maintain it. I simply don&amp;rsquo;t know that I will, and don&amp;rsquo;t feel confidently enough that I will to make any sort of declaration or commitment to doing so. Is there a name for this type of goal? I think &amp;ldquo;intent&amp;rdquo; is appropriate, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t capture the aspirational aspect of it. For now lets call it an &amp;ldquo;aspirational intent&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I aspirationally intend to keep biking to East Rock most mornings, until the weather gets too cold to permit doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
