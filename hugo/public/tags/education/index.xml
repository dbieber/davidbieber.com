      <description>Last week I did a Q+A for the Life at KA blog. The last time I did an education-centric online Q+A was more than three years earlier. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look.
Originally posted at mathcounts.org in March 2010.
How long have you been a MATHCOUNTS coach?
This is my second year coaching the Van Antwerp MATHCOUNTS team.
What is your favorite part about being a MATHCOUNTS coach?
It&amp;rsquo;s great to see my students having a good time with math.</description>

      <description>The best way to learn is to teach. It&amp;rsquo;s also, most of the time, the most fun way to learn. And as an added bonus, the person you&amp;rsquo;re teaching learns too.
I strongly believe that you, as someone who has found themselves reading strange blogs on the internet, have a lot to offer the world in the way of teaching. So I want you to teach at scale. Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you Mom and Dad, former Facebook and Twitter interns, my fellow interns here at Khan Academy.</description>
