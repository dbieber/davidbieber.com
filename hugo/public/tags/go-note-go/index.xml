      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go Note Go is a note-taking system for when you&amp;rsquo;re on the go, with a focus on driving and camping.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re driving to your campsite, listening to Tiago Forte discuss Sönke Ahrens&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;How to Take Smart Notes&amp;rdquo;, when a brilliant idea strikes you. Do you pull over, pull out your phone or moleskin, and write it down? Nay. Go Note Go to the rescue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While driving, simply press the large handheld red push button and speak your idea aloud. It will be automatically transcribed and added to your notes once an internet connection becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go Note Go is the latest in my line&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of headless keyboard technologies, the successor to 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/shh-shell&#34;&gt;shh shell (2014)&lt;/a&gt;. As with 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/shh-shell&#34;&gt;shh shell&lt;/a&gt;, no visual components are required to operate Go Note Go. You control the system only via audio or, optionally, by typing. Unlike with shh shell, it is inadvisable to keep your eyes closed while you use it, particularly if you are driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s dive deeper now into what is Go Note Go, and what it brings to the note-taking space beyond shh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-go-note-go&#34;&gt;What is Go Note Go?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physically, Go Note Go is a lightweight portable keyboard with a microphone and speaker, with a beautiful handheld button attached. The keyboard is a Raspberry Pi 400 &amp;ndash; so, it&amp;rsquo;s also a full computer with WiFi, Bluetooth, and a friendly Linux operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be powered by USB-C either from a small battery pack that velcros to the back, from a port in your car, a port on your main computer, or a standard outlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-does-go-note-go-do&#34;&gt;What does Go Note Go do?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go Note Go allows audio and text note-taking, as well as arbitrary audio and text command execution. Let&amp;rsquo;s focus on note-taking first. We&amp;rsquo;ll return to command execution later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main ways to enter notes with Go Note Go (audio and text), corresponding to the two main use cases (driving and camping). The use cases of shh shell (sleeping and showering) are both still supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Driving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Camping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleeping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Showering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enter notes via &lt;em&gt;audio&lt;/em&gt;, simply press the large red handheld push button. Then speak your notes. The recording will be saved. When internet connectivity becomes available, your audio will be automatically machine transcribed and included in your note-taking system of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enter notes via &lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt;, type them. Press enter to commit a note. Press shift-backspace to clear the currently typed text. When internet connectivity becomes available, your notes will be uploaded to your central note-taking system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking notes by audio is great for driving, or for whenever speaking better suits your way of thinking than typing. Being able to seamlessly go back and forth between speaking and typing can be liberating, allowing for alternating different kinds of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system is compact and portable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;gonotego-front.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Photo of Go Note Go illustrating it is compact and portable.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It velcros to the passenger side of the car dashboard. It can be used there, or placed on a passenger’s lap during use, or even on the driver’s lap at a rest stop, waiting in line at a drive-thru, or while parked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be powered by the car by USB-C, or by battery pack for use on the go (or from a laptop or outlet USB port, if that better suits your use).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;gonotego-dashboard.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Photo of Go Note Go on the passenger side of the car dashboard.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can lie down with it and type or talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;gonotego-soft.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Photo of Go Note Go on a sofa.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or throw it in your sports bag to take notes on the game!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;gonotego-gym-bag.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Photo of Go Note Go in a gym bag.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-do-you-use-go-note-go-in-the-shower&#34;&gt;How do you use Go Note Go in the shower?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use Go Note Go in the shower, acquire a waterproof Bluetooth enabled keyboard, and pair it with your Go Note Go Raspberry Pi 400. Go ahead and leave that waterproof keyboard in your shower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an improved experience, also acquire a waterproof Bluetooth speaker for your shower, and pair this with the Pi as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, your Pi simply has to be in range of your shower for you to use Go Note Go when generating your most groundbreaking insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No additional setup is required. Run the &amp;ldquo;:status&amp;rdquo; command to verify everything is working before typing a note to ensure it doesn&amp;rsquo;t get lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;improvements-over-shh-shell&#34;&gt;Improvements over Shh Shell&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go Note Go supports audio notes and audio commands, whereas shh shell only supported text entry. If you&amp;rsquo;re trying to fall asleep, text is less likely to wake up your mind, but if you&amp;rsquo;re driving, typing is incredibly dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go Note Go works offline and without a laptop nearby. To use shh shell, your keyboard needs to be connected wirelessly to a nearby computer running the shh shell software. Go Note Go&amp;rsquo;s keyboard &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a computer, and it can be powered by battery pack, from a laptop, from an outlet, or from the car. Your notes will be uploaded to your main note-taking system as soon as internet connectivity becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No need for annoying &amp;ldquo;focused&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;focus lost&amp;rdquo; announcements. Anyone who sleeps near you will be pleased to hear Go Note Go is always in focus. So it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to announce &amp;ldquo;focused&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;focus lost&amp;rdquo; for you to know if it&amp;rsquo;s OK to type. LED status indicators are also available for you to confirm it&amp;rsquo;s working (or you can run the &amp;ldquo;:status&amp;rdquo; command to get an auditory &amp;ldquo;ok&amp;rdquo;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go Note Go integrates with external note-taking systems. I personally use Dropbox to store the audio clips and Roam Research to store the notes and display the audio (and now several other note-taking systems are also supported). This allows Go Note Go to directly contribute to my Spaced Repetition system, my notes on other projects, my notes on life, etc, and for my Go Note Go notes to be accessible anywhere, even on the go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go Note Go still supports all the old capabilities of shh shell. All the old commands still work, but now they work everywhere. Entering notes by text still works, but now it&amp;rsquo;s easier to search through them and return to them later. You can still use Go Note Go as you drift off to sleep, and you can still use Go Note Go when you shower, but now you can also use it as you drive or when you camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;supported-note-taking-systems&#34;&gt;Supported Note-taking Systems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audio clips are uploaded to Dropbox for storage (support for Google Drive forthcoming). The audio is then embedded alongside your notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text notes are uploaded to whatever note-taking system you select; currently we support Roam Research, Notion, Ideaflow, Mem, and RemNote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system is extensible to support other storage systems and note-taking systems. I aim to have Go Note Go work with all popular note-taking systems. So, if you want to add a new note-taking system, do get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;issuing-commands&#34;&gt;Issuing Commands&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go Note Go comes with an extensible command system. Like with shh shell, you can issue a textual command by starting a note with a colon &amp;ldquo;:&amp;rdquo;. Examples of supported commands include setting alarms with &amp;ldquo;:at 9am : alarm&amp;rdquo;, or getting the time read aloud to you with &amp;ldquo;:time&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/shh-shell&#34;&gt;shh shell write up&lt;/a&gt; for more on text commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go Note Go supports voice commands too. I use the keyword &amp;ldquo;go go&amp;rdquo; to issue an audio command. &amp;ldquo;go go time&amp;rdquo; will cause the system to read the time aloud. And &amp;ldquo;go go read back&amp;rdquo; will have the system read back your last typed note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-is-it-called-go-note-go&#34;&gt;Why is it called Go Note Go?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a note-taking system for when you&amp;rsquo;re on the go. Like any good note-taking system, it can help you make decisions. This includes but is not limited to go/no-go decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go Note Go is not implemented in Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-not-just-take-notes-on-your-computer-or-phone-or-with-a-voice-recorder&#34;&gt;Why not just take notes on your computer or phone, or with a voice recorder?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go Note Go is great at reducing friction. It&amp;rsquo;s really nice not having to switch to a note-taking app. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to switch tabs or windows. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to wait for anything to load. If the keyboard is there and on, you can type on it and know your notes are being recorded (there are LED status indicators for peace of mind.) No latency means minimal cognitive load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also of course nice not having to do any manual uploading or transcription that other approaches might require. And being integrated with your central note-taking system is a big plus over some alternate app approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support for extensible commands (e.g. for sending messages, reading emails, whatever&amp;hellip;) is a nice plus too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course my favorite feature is that there is no monitor, and so no distractions. There&amp;rsquo;s no endless scrolling on Facebook, no accidentally visiting Reddit or Twitter. Just a keyboard, a button, and your brain at peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-is-go-note-go-extensible&#34;&gt;How is Go Note Go extensible?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two ways. You can bring your own note-taking system, and you can add arbitrary voice and textual commands to Go Note Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note-taking systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go Note Go can support uploading notes to any note-taking system. We started with just Roam Research, and now also support Notion, RemNote, Ideaflow, and Mem. Adding new systems is easy, and if you want to use Go Note Go with a different note-taking system, I&amp;rsquo;d be happy to help you through the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go Note Go also supports voice and text commands. You can add your own commands as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-need-to-push-a-button-instead-of-a-wake-word&#34;&gt;Why need to push a button instead of a wake word?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to feel like I&amp;rsquo;m always being listened to. I also don&amp;rsquo;t want it recording conversations. I only want it to record when I tell it to, and the physical switch is quite satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-can-i-try-it-out&#34;&gt;How can I try it out?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardware components used are listed on the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dbieber/GoNoteGo&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitHub page&lt;/a&gt;. There&amp;rsquo;s no getting started guide yet, so if you are trying it out, don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to reach out for guidance around the rough edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two points define a line, right? &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

      <title>Keyboards, keyboards, everywhere, and not a spot to think</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2022-07-20-keyboards-everywhere/</link>

      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2022-07-20-keyboards-everywhere/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can also listen to this post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;audio
controls
src=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/audio/keyboards-everywhere.m4a&#34;&gt;
Your browser does not support the &lt;code&gt;audio&lt;/code&gt; element.
&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keyboards, keyboards, everywhere, and not a spot to think.
This is take fourteen; I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to write this piece more times than I can count,
but I struggle to merge the various attempts into a coherent whole.
This is relevant, because its representative of an inability to focus on a large abstract piece of thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the result of the state of our technology,
our collective technology,
how it strips us of our attention with notifications,
algorithms designed to keep us captive,
always coming back for more content,
personalized content, personalized content mixed with personalized ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have smart phones and our eyes are glued to them.
We have computers in our pockets &amp;ndash; except they&amp;rsquo;re not in our pockets, they&amp;rsquo;re in our hands &amp;ndash; each with more compute than the Apollo mission computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where did it all go wrong?
There was such a great potential.
Computers &amp;ndash; personal computers &amp;ndash; had the potential to revolutionize the way that humanity thinks.
The potential looked a bit like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before, without computers, thinking was a slow process.
Computers can help.
They can allow us to think bigger, more elaborate, more complex thoughts than we could ever possibly have thought before.
With all the world&amp;rsquo;s information at our finger tips, we can dream truly grand dreams.
Individuals can realize visions that would have taken armies to even conceive of, let alone build, just decades earlier.
Computers, in short, were going to let us Think BIG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where did it all go wrong? And what can we do to set it right?
Today, computers don&amp;rsquo;t let us think big thoughts. Instead, they inhibit thinking.
It takes time to think big thoughts.
But when your brain has been rewired to seek a dopamine hit each time its been without for more than sixteen seconds,
you don&amp;rsquo;t get the continuous uninterrupted time that&amp;rsquo;s required for proper big-thought thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, you scroll a bit more on Facebook, you swipe on TikTok or Instagram or wherever.
You refresh the news.
The big idea your head is working on gets pushed back into the depths of the mind for a little longer.
Maybe it will poke its head out when you take a shower, or the next time you go on a nature hike.
(I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to include the word nature before hike in that sentence, yet here we are. Maybe the thought, the big thought, will come out in your next &lt;em&gt;nature&lt;/em&gt; hike.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I built something.
That&amp;rsquo;s part of why I&amp;rsquo;m writing this piece. I want to show off the thing I built.
It&amp;rsquo;s meant to help with the sort of problem I&amp;rsquo;m describing &amp;ndash; the inability to think big thoughts, because of the incessant attraction of the internet&amp;rsquo;s many distractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing I built, it&amp;rsquo;s called Go Note Go, and it&amp;rsquo;s just a keyboard, with no monitor attached.
You can type on it &amp;ndash; that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m doing now &amp;ndash; or you can talk to it.
And whatever you type or say, once the keyboard gets in range of wifi, will be uploaded to wherever you keep your notes and writings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of this keyboard of course is the absence of the screen.
There are no distractions when typing on this keyboard.
You&amp;rsquo;re just alone with your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t even see what you&amp;rsquo;re typing.
For many people this is a turn off &amp;ndash; how can you type if you can&amp;rsquo;t see what you&amp;rsquo;re typing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, you know what you&amp;rsquo;re typing. You get used to not seeing it pretty quickly.
Sure, you make more typos than you would if you had a screen.
But at the same time, you are freed from having to avoid typos.
You are freed from thinking about revising, wordsmithing, editing of any kind, because you can&amp;rsquo;t go back and you can&amp;rsquo;t change what you&amp;rsquo;ve done.
And so you press on, adding new content, thinking new thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Go Note Go keyboard works in the wilderness; it works if you&amp;rsquo;re camping or hiking, certainly.
You can also bring it with you to bed, and type as you drift off to sleep.
You can even take a waterproof version into the shower with you, and capture your shower thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this idea live dangerously at the edge of allowing you to free your mind to think, and glorifying productivity at the expense of even being free while you sleep and shower? Yes, it sits precisely on that knife edge. It is not a panacea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can make this keyboard more distracting than Reddit itself, if you allow yourself too.
You can spend hours typing when you could be sleeping, or showering when you could be moving on to breakfast or reading the news, because the keyboard lets you pontificate productively rather than wash your hair and be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Go Note Go with caution, and then reap the rewards: a place to think.
A place to think, unencumbered by ads, or messages from friends, or the possibility of an update or an article to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve placed these Go Note Go keyboards all throughout my apartment.
I have one at each place where I might work, so that I can type thoughts without needing to switch to a text editor on my computer.
I simply turn to the Go Note Go and type.
I have one in my bed, and one in my car, which I can talk to as I drive.
If I go camping, one goes into the tent with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I have spaces to think everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title of this post is a play on the classic verse from The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keyboards, keyboards, everywhere, and not a space to think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This line tells us of the failed promise of computers.
They promised us a place to think:
a great tool to allow us to think greater, bigger thoughts than before.
And computers proliferated, both because of the good they do, as well as their siren song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the world we live in lives up to that line now.
There are keyboards everywhere, but they are all attached to monitors, attached to the internet, attached to our pockets and our hands and our minds.
And they leave us with no place to think.
They are water, and we are at sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I present Go Note Go.
It does not fight the tide.
It adds more keyboards, not fewer.
But, in doing so, so long as we proceed with caution,
it reclaims a little bit of our space to think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instructions for how to make your own Go Note Go are available 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dbieber/GoNoteGo&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/go-note-go/&#34;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, go forth into nature, keyboard or no, and think a little.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Writing Another Snippet on Go Note Go</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2022-03-07-snippets-on-gng-ii/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2022 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2022-03-07-snippets-on-gng-ii/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After thinking through 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2022-03-06-gng-snippets-divide/&#34;&gt;the tension between Go Note Go and snippets&lt;/a&gt; yesterday,
I now wonder if there&amp;rsquo;s a good way to write a snippet draft on Go Note Go.
I&amp;rsquo;ve done so 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-09-27-snippet-on-go-note-go/&#34;&gt;once before&lt;/a&gt;, when Go Note Go was only two weeks old, so I know it&amp;rsquo;s possible. But five months later I&amp;rsquo;ve written many snippet-worthy ideas on Go Note Go, but no additional snippets, which leads me to ask &amp;ldquo;why?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first question I would need to answer is at what point during the writing of a snippet draft do I have to know that I&amp;rsquo;m writing a snippet draft. If I have to know upfront, that suggests one interface, whereas if I discover halfway into writing something that I think I&amp;rsquo;m writing a snippet draft, that suggests a different UX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I know upfront, I can create a new session (in the Roam uploader) using shift-enter, and then I can simply type the full snippet draft. That&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m doing now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, however, I discover midway into typing something that I&amp;rsquo;m typing a snippet draft, then it may begin in the middle of a session. This isn&amp;rsquo;t such a big deal; when I clean up the draft I can remove the initial segment that isn&amp;rsquo;t meant to be part of the snippet. The start of the snippet, when I didn&amp;rsquo;t know I was writing a snippet, might be muddier than the rest, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t stand in the way of producing snippet-quality content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both cases, I&amp;rsquo;ll want a way to indicate that I&amp;rsquo;ve written a snippet draft so that I can find it later.
(At this point in the snippet writing I encountered a bug &amp;ndash; notes that contained quotation marks were being dropped! I&amp;rsquo;ve now 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dbieber/GoNoteGo/pull/32&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;fixed this bug&lt;/a&gt;, and am recreating the lost content from this snippet as follows.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple option is to use a hashtag to indicate where a snippet draft lives. If I were working in Roam directly, I would use a two-word hashtag, &amp;ldquo;#[[Snippet draft]]&amp;rdquo;. However, this is a mouthful to type on Go Note Go, which lacks autocomplete (how do you design an autocomplete experience suitable for a headless keyboard?), since getting all that syntax exactly correct is tricky (a hash &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; double-brackets!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If instead we adopt the hyphenated #snippet-draft then the double-brackets become unnecessary. Still simpler is the single word #draft. This seems the easiest to get right consistently if I&amp;rsquo;m going to be typing it in the dark while half asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll adopt that convention for now, and revisit later as needed (it seems unlikely it will be needed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#draft&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This system seems great for writing snippet drafts at GNG when I&amp;rsquo;m in a comfortable typing position, such as at a desk. There does seem to be something missing for when I&amp;rsquo;m drifting off to sleep though, as I often am when using GNG. I&amp;rsquo;m currently comfortably stationed at a desk, so I&amp;rsquo;ll defer thinking through the sleep-GNG-usage snippet writing scenario until after I sleep on it some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having now completed this snippet draft, I&amp;rsquo;m going to head to a computer with a monitor in order to publish it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Hello from the computer-with-monitor! This snippet is headed for publication now!)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Go Note Go / Snippets Divide</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2022-03-06-gng-snippets-divide/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 06 Mar 2022 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2022-03-06-gng-snippets-divide/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love using Go Note Go. Sitting down with no screen, just a keyboard, feels really good.
It clears my head, and straightens out my thoughts. I imagine meditation feels similar to some people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, Go Note Go is fulfilling some of the early objectives of snippets.
It allows me to &lt;em&gt;write&lt;/em&gt; without hesitation or uncertainty.
However, that was not precisely my goal with snippets.
My goal with snippets was to be able to &lt;em&gt;write publicly&lt;/em&gt; without hesitation or uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming back to write this snippet, having written so much in Go Note Go lately,
snippet-writing feels a little heavier than it used to.
It feels a little more like I&amp;rsquo;m writing something public, whereas for so long
snippet-writing had felt like I was writing for no audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, this heaviness faded quickly. Even four paragraphs into this snippet, having now spent a full minute or more reminding myself of my rules and efforts for keeping the barrier to publication low, this feels easy to write again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, there is a tension between Go Note Go writing and snippet writing that this minute of thinking does not resolve.
The tension is this:
I write so much in Go Note Go, including dozens of ideas that would be great to publish for snippets,
but as a result of writing them in Go Note Go, I am less inclined to make snippets of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this? Is it because I have a limited amount of snippet-quality writing time in me, and I&amp;rsquo;ve repurposed it for Go Note Go writing? Is it because writing something I&amp;rsquo;ve already written about is less enjoyable than writing something new? I think it&amp;rsquo;s a combination of these things, more the latter than the former.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I write in Go Note Go, the quality bar is &lt;em&gt;even lower&lt;/em&gt; than for snippets (hard to imagine, I know).
The Go Note Go writing is full of typos and repetitions. The typos are there because I cannot see when I&amp;rsquo;m writing; I do not go back to correct anything because there&amp;rsquo;s no mechanism for it.
Also because Go Note Go is not published anywhere, I can drop inhibitions even further than I do for snippet writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I&amp;rsquo;ve put a snippet idea into Go Note Go, in principle it should be easier to turn into a snippet.
It&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of cleaning up the text from Go Note Go to make it snippet-worthy.
Snippet-worthy is a much lower bar than story-worthy.
However, cleaning up text from Go Note Go to produce a snippet doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem as rewarding as writing a snippet from scratch. Snippet-writing is like thinking; Go Note Go-cleaning is another type of activity altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, there are ideas in my Go Note Go writing that I do want to publish. So, my proposed strategy is this: I&amp;rsquo;ll write snippets about those ideas from scratch, when it feels appropriate to do so. I already review my Go Note Go notes periodically, so now when I do so I&amp;rsquo;ll keep an eye out for snippet-worthy ideas. By doing so, I think there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance some of them will turn themselves into snippets simply by virtue of being sufficiently interesting to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest such idea that comes to mind is &amp;ldquo;Keyboards, keyboards, everywhere, and not a spot to think.&amp;rdquo;
This is a blog post idea I&amp;rsquo;ve written multiple parts of in different places, but which I haven&amp;rsquo;t pulled together into its complete form yet. It&amp;rsquo;s a post about the promise of technology, how attention-seeking tech has prevented us from delivering on that promise, and how headless keyboards like Go Note Go provide a path toward reclaiming our attention and allowing us to reach out fullest potential as users of modern tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A blog post isn&amp;rsquo;t a snippet, but I&amp;rsquo;ve decided (after initial hesitation) that it would be totally fine to produce snippets using content that will ideally eventually make it into a blog post.
This is similar to my decision to allow myself to publish incomplete snippets.
It trades off some novelty when the blog post is finally published in return for keeping the bar to publishing snippets extraordinarily low. I value that goal more than I value preserving any kind of surprisal when I publish a blog post, rare as that is.
So, I&amp;rsquo;m likely to write about the &amp;ldquo;Keyboards, keyboards, everywhere, and not a spot to think&amp;rdquo; idea in snippets well before producing the blog post I aspire for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In writing this snippet, I trawled through some of my Go Note Go writing. It&amp;rsquo;s fun for me to look through. It&amp;rsquo;s a distraction from finishing this snippet though. I look forward to writing snippets about some of the ideas I encounter in these Go Note Go expeditions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Go Note Go Writing Volume</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2022-02-14-go-note-go-writing-volume/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2022 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2022-02-14-go-note-go-writing-volume/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing a lot, but not putting up any new snippets.
Where has all the writing gone? Into 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/go-note-go&#34;&gt;Go Note Go&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been 150 days since I started Go Note Go.
I have written on Go Note Go on 91 of those days, producing 54,000 words.
I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a little over 24 hours total doing so, making my writing speed a bit shy of 40 wpm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I review more of my Go Note Go writing than I might expect, given its volume and that none of it has translated into published snippets.
Since 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2022-01-08-gng-messager-snippet-plans/&#34;&gt;turning Go Note Go into an outliner&lt;/a&gt;,
the experience of reviewing my writing has been much more comfortable than it was previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I write in Go Note Go using the &amp;ldquo;Roam Research&amp;rdquo; uploader, my writing is divided into &amp;ldquo;sessions&amp;rdquo;.
Each session starts with a line containing only the time. The rest of the writing is nested beneath.
&lt;img src=&#34;session.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I review my writing in Go Note Go, I do so session by session, putting a summary of the session in that top line of the session, and then collapsing the session. Often the top line is a block-reference to one or more of the lines from the session. For example,
&lt;img src=&#34;session-collapsed.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This compresses the 600 words I might write on a given day and presents them in a series of often 10 or fewer individual lines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Two Snippets I want to write about GNG and Messager</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2022-01-08-gng-messager-snippet-plans/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2022 02:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2022-01-08-gng-messager-snippet-plans/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have two new ideas for snippets I want to write. They&amp;rsquo;re about Go Note Go and Messager Queue, both side projects I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting a bunch of time into the last few days. The snippet ideas are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using Go Note Go as an outliner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding Hacker News to Messager Queue, and then auto-queuing Twitter and HN posts for snippets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is about &lt;em&gt;using Go Note Go as an outliner&lt;/em&gt;. This is a new feature I&amp;rsquo;ve added to Go Note Go just in the last day or so. Before yesterday, each note entered via Go Note Go was it&amp;rsquo;s own bullet in your note-taking system. Now (at least for Roam), you can also use tab to indent and dedent notes.
This sounds simple, but thinking through the user experience, taking into consideration that there is no screen, was a fun experience.
It also sounds like an only marginal improvement, but for me it&amp;rsquo;s been rewarding more than I expected. It has interesting interactions with the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/post/2022-01-08-new-messager-setup/&#34;&gt;new message sending feature&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; making sending messages even more enjoyable.
And it lends itself well to progressive summarization and chronologically organized notes;
with the current implementation, each note-taking &amp;ldquo;session&amp;rdquo; has a timestamp and blank space for a summary at the top of the session. I can fill in the blank space and then collapse the notes, making it easier to skim through them later.
Perhaps these summaries will serve as training / fine-tuning data for an autosummarizer later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second snippet idea is a new script I am thinking of writing that will add messages to my new Messager Queue automatically.
I&amp;rsquo;ve toyed with the idea of sharing more of my snippets publicly in the past.
Currently, I only share them very rarely.
Only partially is this an active decision; it is also partially inertia and there being an activation energy and unnaturalness for me in posting publicly.
While the active decision reasons will remain, having auto-generated messages populate my Messager Queue periodically will really dilute any inertia / activation energy / unnaturalness reasons for not sharing snippets, and those are precisely the reasons I want to eliminate.
Doing this will require a small change to the Messager Queue to support Hacker News; this should only take a few minutes, as HN is already supported by Messager.
Then, it will likely take a few hours to write a script that periodically adds messages about my snippets to my Messager Queue.
One source of these messages will be the &amp;ldquo;message&amp;rdquo; field at the top of some of my snippet frontmatters.
For others I can just make a templated message using the snippet title; the beauty of Messager Queue is I don&amp;rsquo;t need to autogenerate the perfect message, since I can tweak or rewrite it before approving the message to go out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;rsquo;ve now put down all the things I wanted to say about those two snippets. Does it still make sense to write them? I don&amp;rsquo;t know; I might turn them into new snippets anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sending messages as I drift off to sleep</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/post/2022-01-08-new-messager-setup/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/post/2022-01-08-new-messager-setup/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post I describe my new Messager setup,
and how it allows me to send messages directly from Roam Research &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt;
from a standalone keyboard (no monitor) that I keep at my bedside as I drift off to sleep, and which I take driving and camping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently my setup supports sending messages to
Facebook Messenger, Twitter,
Slack, Discord, and iMessage.
I intend to add gChat and email support next, since there are still a handful of people I want to message that don&amp;rsquo;t use any of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above all else, the beauty of this project to me is its usability,
which is hard to communicate in a write-up like this.
Some of the usability comes from the way the components integrate with my existing workflows.
Some of the usability comes from design choices
(like using a keyboard with no monitor for note-taking and message drafting).
I&amp;rsquo;ll try to point out these usability elements along the way.
Bear in mind I designed this primarily for myself
(though I have a handful of friends along for the ride as well, trying it out and making their own contributions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s dive in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;go-note-go-the-headless-keyboard&#34;&gt;Go Note Go: The Headless Keyboard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some background, I developed Go Note Go, a headless keyboard designed for note-taking on the go.
Go Note Go is a note-taking system for when you&amp;rsquo;re on the go, with a focus on driving and camping.
You can 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/go-note-go&#34;&gt;read all about Go Note Go here&lt;/a&gt; and learn more on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dbieber/gonotego&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;its GitHub page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go Note Go&amp;rsquo;s main purpose is note-taking.
Anything you type into Go Note Go or voice-record into it gets transcribed and uploaded to your notes as soon as it gets an internet connection.
For me, Go Note Go uploads to Roam Research. It also supports RemNote, IdeaFlow, Mem, and Notion, and adding additional systems isn&amp;rsquo;t too difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the usability perks of Go Note Go is that there is no monitor. This means you can&amp;rsquo;t get distracted browsing the internet while writing on Go Note Go. You also can&amp;rsquo;t get distracted wordsmithing your own writing. It makes writing pleasurable, even if it comes at the cost of having typos and stray thoughts in your writing; you can always clean those up later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go Note Go does a lot more, so I do encourage you to 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/go-note-go&#34;&gt;learn more about it&lt;/a&gt;, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t the focus of this post, which is about sending messages.
For the purposes of this post, Go Note Go is a data entry system for Roam. And since I&amp;rsquo;ve also built a system that allows sending messages directly from Roam, this means I can now send messages directly from Go Note Go. So, I can send messages when driving, camping, and as I drift off to sleep at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To send a message in Go Note Go, you simply &amp;ldquo;@&amp;rdquo; the person you are writing to. To send a message to Adriana, I would write &amp;ldquo;@Adriana Message goes here&amp;rdquo;. To send a message to David Dohan (using first and last name), I could write &amp;ldquo;@David Dohan: Message goes here&amp;rdquo;. You can @ someone at any point in the message. You can also @ multiple people, and Messager will send them a group message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go Note Go acts as an outliner now too; this is both a big usability improvement for Go Note Go on it&amp;rsquo;s own, and doubly so for using Go Note Go as a messager. An &amp;ldquo;outliner&amp;rdquo; is a system for taking notes as a series of nested bullets. You can push tab to indent notes underneath other notes; I&amp;rsquo;ve developed a user experience that makes this moderately natural, even in the absence of a monitor or any other visual feedback. For sending messages, the outliner feature is a boon. Any notes you nest under an @&amp;rsquo;d note will also register as additional messages for the @&amp;rsquo;d recipients. This makes writing longer multiline messages a pleasure, even without a monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default behavior of my messaging system is to hold the messages for approval before sending them. So, the messages that I write as I drift off to sleep don&amp;rsquo;t send as I drift off to sleep. Instead, I see them in the morning and approve them, and only upon being approved are they sent automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This delayed-approve-then-send approach is particularly well suited for Go Note Go, where I likely make typos and want to clean up the messages before they are sent, since I am writing them without a monitor. Later in the post I&amp;rsquo;ll dive into what the approval process looks like (tl;dr there&amp;rsquo;s a spreadsheet where I can mark a message as &amp;ldquo;OK&amp;rdquo; to send), but first I want to share additional benefits of being able to send messages directly from my note-taking app, which is currently Roam Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;drafting-messages-in-roam-research&#34;&gt;Drafting Messages in Roam Research&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything I write on my Go Note Go appears in Roam Research, but I can also take notes directly in Roam.
Just like on Go Note Go, the way to draft a message in Roam is to &amp;ldquo;@&amp;rdquo; the person you are writing to.
Messager has some heuristics it uses to translate your @&amp;rsquo;s into proper recipients.
So, the syntax for @&amp;lsquo;ing someone isn&amp;rsquo;t too strict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Roam offers some possibilities beyond what I can do on Go Note Go, such as including images in messages.
Like on Go Note Go, you can use nested bullets to create longer messages,
and you can @ as many people as you want for a message.
In Roam, however, you can also include images in your messages.
Messager will intelligently send those in the native format used by the underlying messaging service,
rather than blindly sending the markdown stored in Roam.
I find this feature, being able to use images naturally in Roam, and then have them send naturally as messages,
quite pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One future direction I&amp;rsquo;d like for this project is to add a &amp;ldquo;send&amp;rdquo; button in Roam next to any messages I&amp;rsquo;ve drafted there,
as well as to display the status of the messages inline in my notes. That&amp;rsquo;s not implemented now, but would be a nice-to-have for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, all messages are automatically added to my &amp;ldquo;messager queue&amp;rdquo; where they wait for approval before being sent.
I like having this approve-before-sending approach as the default, since it psychologically frees me up to write things I might not otherwise write if I was instead using a send button that sent immediately.
However, sometimes being able to send something immediately is desirable, and that&amp;rsquo;s not a clean option in the current setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;roam-to-sheets-the-messager-queue&#34;&gt;Roam to Sheets: The Messager Queue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any messages in Roam (whether entered directly into Roam, or entered via Go Note Go), are automatically added to a spreadsheet, the &amp;ldquo;Messager Queue&amp;rdquo;. These are the spreadsheet&amp;rsquo;s columns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Service&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Recipient&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Date&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Time&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Approval&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Status&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Metadata&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Messager Queue sheet is filtered by default to show all pending messages. For each message it shows the &lt;em&gt;Service&lt;/em&gt; on which it will be sent and well as the &lt;em&gt;Recipient&lt;/em&gt; of the message. The service can be one of FB Messenger, Twitter, iMessage, a Slack server, or Discord. The recipient can either be an individual, a list of individuals, a group, a Slack channel, or a Discord server and channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also a sheet that lists aliases, so it&amp;rsquo;s easy to use a short name or informal name to refer to a longer service or recipient; e.g. I use &amp;ldquo;@Audio Tools&amp;rdquo; as a shorthand for sending to a group of 5 people on Messenger all interested in audio tools for networked thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Messager Queue sheet also displays the &lt;em&gt;Text&lt;/em&gt; of the message to send, so you can easily clean up the message here for any typos or clarifications before it is sent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Date&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; columns allow for scheduling messages to be sent at any point in the future. Leave them blank and the message will be sent as soon as it is approved. Use keyboard shortcuts cmd-; (for date) and cmd-shift-; (for time) to quickly fill out these columns if desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the &lt;em&gt;Approval&lt;/em&gt; column is the most important. Mark a messages as OK if you want it to be sent, or as Ignored if you deside to skip it. The &lt;em&gt;Status&lt;/em&gt; column is updated automatically by Messager when the message is sent (or if it fails to send, then the error appears here). You can also mark the Status manually with whatever value you want (e.g. if you send the message manually), and the Messager system will ignore that message going forward. If you want the system to retry sending a message, simply clear out the Status column and it will try again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I include this spreadsheet as a custom service in 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://getferdi.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ferdi&lt;/a&gt;, so it lives alongside all the messaging apps I use. (This in itself might be the subject of a future 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets&#34;&gt;snippet&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-the-approval-system-over-immediate-messages&#34;&gt;Why the approval system over immediate messages?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond allowing me to catch a bunch of typos, it&amp;rsquo;s also a psychologically useful thing for me.
I am more willing to write and I feel able to say more things that I might not otherwise,
knowing I have the opportunity to cancel or change the message later.
In that way, it&amp;rsquo;s like gmail&amp;rsquo;s undo feature. In gmail, undo not a true undo, but having those 30 seconds after clicking send to retract the message make a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another benefit of sending the messages only after approving them is the ability to sleep at night. If I write a message at night, I know you haven&amp;rsquo;t responded yet because my messages haven&amp;rsquo;t even sent yet; they&amp;rsquo;ll go out in the morning, after I&amp;rsquo;ve had a chance to clean them up. So, I don&amp;rsquo;t spend any mental effort wondering if there&amp;rsquo;s a response from you. It also allows me to set the appropriate tone for the messages, by having them go out at a reasonable time, rather than appearing urgent by being sent in the middle of the night. And it does this without me needing to keep the message draft in my head as I sleep. So, I sleep better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why, while the ability to send messages immediately would also be a good feature to add, I am inclined to leave approve-in-the-morning messages as the system&amp;rsquo;s default behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;notifications-from-bieber-bot&#34;&gt;Notifications from Bieber Bot&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One additional small usability feature is that Bieber Bot will message me in the morning or evening whenever there are messages in the Messager Queue awaiting my approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds like a small convenience, and in fact has proven even more useful than it might at first sound.
When I wake up in the morning, I sometimes don&amp;rsquo;t remember that I&amp;rsquo;ve written messages the preceding night.
So, having Bieber Bot send me the link to the Messager Queue and gently remind me to approve the messages has been
consistently charming and welcome. Thanks, Bieber Bot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;automatic-sending-from-sheets-with-messager&#34;&gt;Automatic Sending from Sheets with Messager&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messager is the underlying system that sends the messages in the Messager Queue system.
As noted previously, it supports
Facebook Messenger, Twitter,
Slack, Discord, and iMessage.
It also supports Hacker News, which hasn&amp;rsquo;t been so useful for this project.
And I am thinking I may add gChat and email support next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use Messager for more than just sending messages from the Messager Queue spreadsheet;
it also backs other projects like my 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-30-sql-for-the-kangaroo-auto-responder/&#34;&gt;Kangaroo Auto-responder&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/bieber-bot/&#34;&gt;several parts of Bieber Bot&lt;/a&gt;.
Its purpose, in the most broad sense, is to support programmatically sending and receiving messages in a uniform manner across all the messaging systems I use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Facebook Messager, it uses 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://fbchat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;fbchat&lt;/a&gt; to enable programmatically sending and receiving messages as myself. It also uses Facebook&amp;rsquo;s API to allow sending messages as Bieber Bot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Twitter, it uses the API to support public tweets, private tweets (using a separate account; 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/post/2021-03-07-roam-twitter-bot-dev-guide/&#34;&gt;see here for how I use this to reclaim my attention&lt;/a&gt;), and DMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For iMessage, it uses AppleScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slack and Discord are the most recent additions, and they currently live outside the core Messager system;
they are implemented using Browserflow flows.
This means that I am effectively sending Slack and Discord messages as myself, rather than using an API to do so.
The messages are sent in a browser using clicks and keyboard presses,
all in the same human-centric UI that I would use if I were to send the messages manually.
I&amp;rsquo;m so grateful to Browserflow for making this possible, as Slack and Discord have been really key additions to this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reflections-on-the-setup&#34;&gt;Reflections on the setup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the setup for only a few days so far, and am continuing to actively develop it.
So far, I absolutely love it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headless typing experience provided by Go Note Go makes for a great environment for drafting messages.
So too does using Roam Research while scrolling through social media. (I&amp;rsquo;m the sort of person who doesn&amp;rsquo;t usually like replying publicly to social media posts, but does enjoy engaging with them in 1:1 or small group chat messages.)
Drifting off to sleep has proven to be another excellent time to share thoughts with friends.
I don&amp;rsquo;t want to start &lt;em&gt;a conversation&lt;/em&gt; with friends as I drift off to sleep, but loads of thoughts come to mind that I do want to share with people, and so adding them to my Messager Queue to send the next day has been quite satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this interests you, feel free to get in touch.
If you do, I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best to get back to you, likely as I&amp;rsquo;m drifting off to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Go Note Go Messager without Pixel-Space Automation</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2022-01-02-pixel-space-automation/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2022-01-02-pixel-space-automation/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This snippet was originally going to be about pixel-space automation. Then I found I didn&amp;rsquo;t need it for what I wanted to do: sending messages to Twitter, Facebook, Slack, and Discord from Go Note Go, Roam Research, and Bieber Bot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year! I&amp;rsquo;d really like to automate Mac apps that don&amp;rsquo;t expose actions to Automator
using pixel-space navigation and clicks and typing to control the automation. This is why and how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Update from the end of the snippet: By the time I finished writing the snippet, I had automated everything I intended to using browser automation in Browserflow, never once needing to automate Ferdi. I still think pixel-space automation would be wonderful, but my initial motivation for it turns out to be insufficient.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;motivation-improving-messager-by-automating-ferdi&#34;&gt;Motivation: Improving Messager by Automating Ferdi&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a side project &amp;ldquo;Messager&amp;rdquo; that allows for programmatically sending and receiving messages
across a wide variety of messaging services.
I also use Ferdi for manually managing an even wider variety of messaging services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently Messager supports
Facebook Messenger (as myself and as Bieber Bot),
Twitter (public tweets, private tweets, and DMs),
HackerNews,
and it has limited support for Slack and Discord.
Ferdi, on the other hand, supports a much wider range of services, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t offer programmatic access;
I use Ferdi with
Facebook Messenger (as myself and as Bieber Bot),
Twitter (public tweets, private tweets, and DMs),
multiple Slacks,
Discord,
Gitter,
WhatsApp,
Telegram,
as well as for non-messaging services like Roam Research,
multiple spreadsheets,
supervisord,
and other adhoc use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to extend Messager to have wider support,
particularly to improve support for Slack and Discord.
To do this, &lt;mark&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d love to automate Ferdi&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;motivation-go-note-go---messager-bridge&#34;&gt;Motivation: Go Note Go - Messager Bridge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do I want to improve Messager &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;? It&amp;rsquo;s because of 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/go-note-go&#34;&gt;Go Note Go&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m adding messaging support to Go Note Go. The main use case I&amp;rsquo;m targeting is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m drifting off to sleep and realize I want to tell someone something.
So I write in Go Note Go something along the lines of &amp;ldquo;Tell John Smith Hey John, I have this new idea for Go Note Go where you can send messages as your drifting off to sleep &amp;ndash; maybe I can tell you about it tomorrow&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I wake up the following morning, Bieber Bot has messaged me with a link to a spreadsheet.
It has all the messages I drafted the previous night (they haven&amp;rsquo;t been sent yet).
There, I can clean them up for any typos and &amp;ldquo;approve&amp;rdquo; them (mark them as OK to send).
And once they&amp;rsquo;re approved, they&amp;rsquo;ll be sent automatically using Messager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s in support of this project that I&amp;rsquo;d love for Messager to support a wider variety of services.
Ideally the system will intelligently select the service to use to send the message based on the recipients.
It will include the service in the spreadsheet, so that I can adjust the service if needed before approving the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is going to be a Go_Note_Go-Sheets-Messager-Bieber_Bot collab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tl;dr Go Note Go adds draft messages to a spreadsheet. Bieber Bot uses that spreadsheet to message me about new draft messages, and to message friends on my behalf with approved messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;motivation-going-beyond&#34;&gt;Motivation: Going beyond&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Messager application described so far, pixel-space automation is not necessary.
All of the services I want to automate can be opened in the Browser,
and so existing Browser automation techniques are sufficient.
I would use Browserflow for this if it supported programmatic triggers, but it does not.
(Psst&amp;hellip; DK, can you add the ability to programmatically trigger a local flow please?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this, why is pixel-space automation interesting?
It&amp;rsquo;s because it would enable
(1) easier automation construction for the automations I&amp;rsquo;m interested in
and (2) it enables a much larger class of automations, and empowerment is key.

&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-12-07-future-automation-software/&#34;&gt;See here for my dreams for the future of automation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ferdi-actions&#34;&gt;Ferdi Actions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main actions I want for the Messager application are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ferdi: Navigating to different services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discord: Choosing a server, channel, or recipient&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discord: Sending and receiving messages on that channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slack: Choosing a channel or recipient&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slack: Sending and receiving messages on that channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-challenge&#34;&gt;The Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;why-are-the-discord-and-slack-apis-not-sufficient&#34;&gt;Why are the Discord and Slack APIs not sufficient?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Discord and Slack have policies against using self-bots. Their APIs don&amp;rsquo;t allow you to programmatically control your own user account. So, controlling your account as a human would, through the provided chat client, is a natural way to approach the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantages of using Ferdi over the browser are: (1) it uses service hibernation, so you can skip loading the pages and logging in each time you start using a website, (2) maybe you can keep using the browser while Ferdi automates in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these actions is doable using existing browser automation tools. Navigating to different services in the browser requires authentication though, if you&amp;rsquo;re not already logged in (which I would be in Ferdi). Perhaps with Browserflow&amp;rsquo;s cookie sharing feature, I can also already be logged in at the start of a Browserflow flow even on Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;current-status&#34;&gt;Current Status&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a break in the middle of writing this flow and now I&amp;rsquo;ve implemented sending messages via Browserflow in both Slack and Discord.
I&amp;rsquo;ve also gone further toward the Go Note Go-Messager bridge,
implementing a few of the other steps.
Whenever I use &amp;ldquo;@Person&amp;rdquo; in Roam, Bieber Bot automatically copies the message into a spreadsheet.
The spreadsheet has an &amp;ldquo;Approval&amp;rdquo; column, where I can mark messages as OK to send.
Bieber Bot will then use Messager to send any approved messages.
Since Go Note Go sends it&amp;rsquo;s notes to Roam, this completes the circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can now send messages from Go Note Go to any of Facebook Messenger, Twitter, Slack, and Discord.
I&amp;rsquo;m still excited about pixel-space automation, but I&amp;rsquo;ll have to save that excitement for a future snippet; for now, Browserflow was sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve put together a hardware guide so you can build your own Go Note Go. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep a version of this in the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dbieber/GoNoteGo&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Go Note Go GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt; too. This one will likely fall out of date, but I&amp;rsquo;ll try to keep the one in the GitHub repo updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;raspberry-pi-400&#34;&gt;Raspberry Pi 400&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details: I use the US keyboard. You can purchase from e.g. PiShop. I recommend ordering the following as a bundle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Raspberry Pi 400 unit ($70)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Class 10 microSD Card With Raspbian - 16GB&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes: I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten these set up with Go Note Go yet, but am considering them as an alternative to the Adafruit Voice Bonnet. I really like the LEDs on the voice bonnet though, so TBD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost: $19&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-tools&#34;&gt;Other tools:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;external-monitor-and-a-usb-mouse&#34;&gt;External monitor and a USB Mouse.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These will be useful for configuring and debugging Go Note Go, e.g. setting up WiFi and configuring your note-taking system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wire-wire-stripper&#34;&gt;Wire, Wire Stripper&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use The Beautiful Red Button you&amp;rsquo;ll need wire and wire strippers. For wire I used 18 gauge lamp wire I got from Home Depot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possible link: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lowes.com/pd/Southwire-25-Ft-18-2-Black-Stranded-Lamp-Cord/5001050863&#34;&gt;https://www.lowes.com/pd/Southwire-25-Ft-18-2-Black-Stranded-Lamp-Cord/5001050863&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes: I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this is the best choice for wire; a higher gauge might be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;solder-soldering-iron&#34;&gt;Solder? Soldering iron?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t had to use solder yet, but might need to for hooking up the button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hot glue or heat shrink and a heat gun might be nice-to-haves too to ensure solid stable connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;possible-other-parts-for-button&#34;&gt;Possible other parts for button&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These might be useful for connecting the button to the GPIO pins on the Pi:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0774NMT1S&#34;&gt;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0774NMT1S&lt;/a&gt;
I don&amp;rsquo;t know. In my experience these were too loose to fit nicely on the GPIO pins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to try these next: GenBasic 40 Piece Female to Female Jumper Wires (4 Inch) &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077N58HFK&#34;&gt;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077N58HFK&lt;/a&gt; ($5)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Note-taking System Interoperability</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-10-09-note-taking-system-interop/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 09 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-10-09-note-taking-system-interop/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What would be a good &lt;em&gt;standard&lt;/em&gt; for note-taking software to use to support development of system-agnostic tools like Go Note Go? In this snippet I discuss the value such a standard could provide; I expect it will be useful in future brainstorming for what exactly would go into such a standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am building Go Note Go as a note-taking entry point, possibly with some basic retrieval features (e.g. &amp;ldquo;read back the last two notes I took&amp;rdquo;). I currently use Roam Research as my main note-taking system, but I&amp;rsquo;m not wedded to it forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;rsquo;m building Go Note Go to work with any note-taking system. To do so, I need a distinct uploader implementation for every note-taking system that I support. I&amp;rsquo;m reaching out to the developers at the note-taking systems to assist with this effort. It would be lovely if there was a standard, to reduce the amount of work required here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Go Note Go, only note &lt;em&gt;entry&lt;/em&gt; is required. If Go Note Go wanted to interact with the notes in a deeper way while continuing to support multiple note-taking systems (e.g. to support spaced repetition, or grocery lists, or reviewing a topic), then a standard would be even more important. Specialized implementations for each note-taking system would become largely untenable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is both common and important that hobbyists develop tools for interacting with their notes. Roam Research has 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://roamjs.com/extensions&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;hundreds&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://roamresearch.com/#/app/roam-depot-developers/page/8yTj7WxQi&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://bjosephburch.com/ultimate-roam-tool-kit/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;extensions&lt;/a&gt; developed by the Roam community. Obsidian has hundreds of 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md/plugins&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;plugins&lt;/a&gt;. This is part of what makes these tools so powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my knowledge, no one has written a tool for both Roam and Obsidian simultaneously. I want people to be able to make tools for all of Roam, Obsidian, IdeaFlow, Mem, RemNote, Notion, Logseq, Athens, Dendron, all the ones I don&amp;rsquo;t know about, and whatever comes next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these tools will live inside the note-taking editor. Others, like Go Note Go, merely have to interact with the note-taking system, but do not need to become &lt;em&gt;part&lt;/em&gt; of the note-taking system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some key areas where standards could provide value are: note representation, entry, navigation, editing, and search. Also valuable, but conceptually separate, would be a standard for UI extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standards would make the development of system-agnostic tools easier. This includes novel note entry systems (e.g. 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/shh-shell&#34;&gt;shh-shell&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/go-note-go&#34;&gt;Go Note Go&lt;/a&gt;, but also note entry systems for new domains, such as for doctor&amp;rsquo;s offices or for while you&amp;rsquo;re cooking, or for use in virtual reality). It also would support advancements in spaced repetition, multiplayer note-taking, and would enable new features like note summarization and highlight extraction to become available in all the different note-taking systems at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to all these applications, standards will make import/export/backup tools easier to build. This can reduce vendor lock in, and more importantly can reduce data loss by enabling robust backups. Today, switching my notes to another system would be a small hassle (e.g. Handling block references in the transfer might require some specialized treatment. And I&amp;rsquo;d need to do some work to set up a spaced repetition system like the one I&amp;rsquo;m currently using in Roam.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll say a few words about some of these ideas that would benefit from standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) &lt;strong&gt;Advancements in spaced repetition.&lt;/strong&gt; Having a spaced repetition system inside of a note-taking system is far lower friction than a separate app. Improvements to SRS that work across all note-taking systems would be warmly welcomed. I believe there are also significant advances to be made in community-scale spaced repetition, where cards and knowledge are drawn from not just your own notes, but from your community&amp;rsquo;s notes (including peers and teachers), and where your review schedule is similarly influenced not only by your own learning progress, but also by the progress of your community. This deserves a separate snippet, but I&amp;rsquo;ll note here a possibility that community-scale spaced repetition enables: it allows for community-level learning priorities, which may include diversity of topic. For example the members of a community might decide they want to ensure that all of its history is adequately studied (or any other collection of topics), not just the most interesting parts. Deciding individually, the members of the community might choose to study overly overlapping parts of its history. Using a community-scale spaced repetition algorithm, the choice of what to study can still predominantly be left up to individuals, but with small guidance from the centralized algorithm the community can ensure complete coverage of all the desired topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) &lt;strong&gt;Multiplayer Note-taking&lt;/strong&gt; Let&amp;rsquo;s say I&amp;rsquo;m doing research on a topic, and a colleague is doing research on a related topic. I might want to search through my colleague&amp;rsquo;s notes, and reference some of them from my own notes. This isn&amp;rsquo;t even possible in most note-taking systems today, but I think is either a future or work-in-progress feature of Roam, Athens, and Obsidian. Being able to do this cross-system would be so much better than only being able to do it within a system. A standard agreed upon by the different note-taking system developers would be necessary to support this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) &lt;strong&gt;Summarization and highlight extraction&lt;/strong&gt; Summarization is a feature not yet present in any note-taking system, but surely one that will be added to many systems in the future. It is the ability to get a (machine generated) summary of a large chunk of notes automatically. This is marginally useful when reviewing your own notes, but is even more useful in conjunction with multiplayer features. Being able to view a summary of other people&amp;rsquo;s notes or an entire community&amp;rsquo;s notes will allow multiplayer systems to scale to larger groups of people while remaining useful. Highlight extraction is a related future feature, enabling users to quickly find the most important parts of a notebase. As with summarization, this is useful for an individuals notes, and doubly useful for a multiplayer notebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each of these ideas, standards would be useful for allowing feature development to benefit users of all systems simultaneously, and for allowing users of one note-taking system to benefit from notes taken in another system. The space of possible applications is also much larger than my brainstorming above indicates. Specifically, the set of domain-specific activities one might want to perform with their notes is quite large (planning a family gathering, studying for a med school exam, writing a novel, etc.) Specialized applications could be built for each of these, and it should not matter where the relevant notes were taken. Different systems will always have their pros and cons for different types of content, but we don&amp;rsquo;t need to reinvent the wheel so frequently for use-cases that make sense in the context of all these different systems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Writing a Snippet with Go Note Go</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-09-27-snippet-on-go-note-go/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-09-27-snippet-on-go-note-go/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been developing and concurrently using Go Note Go for two weeks now, and in that time I have come to love the frictionless way it allows me to dump thoughts into the machine. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a chance to reread what I&amp;rsquo;ve written. There&amp;rsquo;s no going back and rewording something. And more than that, there&amp;rsquo;s no waiting for the characters to show up, or switching tabs, or spell checking or anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time I&amp;rsquo;m writing a snippet using Go Note Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about writing a snippet about Go Note Go over the last two weeks, but I decided not to until yesterday when I finally stopped keeping Go Note Go to myself.
I thought maybe there would be value in getting Go Note Go polished, e.g. writing a getting started guide or even a sales page, and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; publishing it once people can actually use it themselves.
But I decided against that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Done is better than perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might not find a good way to package Go Note Go so that people can start using it with relative ease.
Certainly I can do better than I have so far − there&amp;rsquo;s little help at all for someone to put together their own system.
That said, a motivated individual could in principle piece together their own Go Note Go from what I&amp;rsquo;ve published now.
And I&amp;rsquo;d be happy to help them do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even if someone had to ask too many questions or can&amp;rsquo;t reproduce the full setup, maybe they&amp;rsquo;ll take the concept in a new direction.
&amp;ldquo;Headless note−taking&amp;rdquo; is a broad idea and I&amp;rsquo;ve just scratched the surface.
We can see from shh shell and Go Note Go alone that there are diverse approaches one can take to this broad concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to take it further myself, but more than that I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to start the conversation about headless note−taking since it might be able to help a much broader set of people than it&amp;rsquo;s helping right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it would be great in classrooms to avoid distractions.
Maybe there are headless audio−only applications for writers, for programmers, for producers, for lawyers and doctors and publicists and influencers and so forth that are just waiting to be developed.
Different keyboard shortcuts could be specialized for different domains. The addition of foot peddles might help some users. Whatever is needed to make this maximally useful for different applications and different people&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s already super useful for people, but there&amp;rsquo;s just no way for those people to know right now because they can&amp;rsquo;t easily try it, or haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of it and thought about it. This is wishful thinking of course; it might be an esoteric toy that is only useful or fun for a small group, but I&amp;rsquo;m confident that group is larger than just myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I want to put this out there a little bit. I&amp;rsquo;d like to share it with Conor of Roam, and with Andy Matuschak, and with folks at IdeaFlow and with Notion users, and with Obsidian folks, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I&amp;rsquo;d like to get out of sharing with these groups is contributors to the extensible uploader side of Go Note Go.
I think it would be so cool if each supported note−taking system had an uploader contributed by someone working at that note−taking system&amp;rsquo;s company. Conor or Bardia could make a contribution to the Roam uploader. Jacob or Linus could write the IdeaFlow uploader. Someone from Obsidian and Notion could provide uploaders for each of those. Now that the GitHub for the project is public, this is easier to start working toward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the more I think about the getting started guide, the easier it seems to write. There are only a few steps you really need to follow to get set up. Roughly, it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acquire the parts (Raspberry Pi, MicroSD card, optional battery pack, USB cords, a speaker and microphone compatible with the Pi (a Voice Bonnet is one option, but any will do.))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clone Go Note Go&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit config&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put start script in rc.local file to start on startup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be sure to configure your wifi wpa config file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wishful thinking again: I could probably write a decent guide in under an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Go Note Go is public</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Go Note Go is public! I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on this for two weeks now, and today I made it public!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/go-note-go&#34;&gt;Read all about it here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is it? Go Note Go is a note-taking system for when you’re on the go, with a focus on driving and camping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, it&amp;rsquo;s a portable keyboard with a microphone and speakers and a beautiful handheld button that you can use to take notes anywhere at all. Driving? Push the button and speak your notes. Camping? Type on the keyboard, powered by a battery pack. The battery lasts all day, and the notes will be uploaded to your central note-taking system as soon as internet becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a look. Let me know what you think! I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it as I develop it over the last two weeks and I &lt;em&gt;really love&lt;/em&gt; it. I keep it by my computer during the work day. I took it with me to my table tennis tournament yesterday. I&amp;rsquo;ve brought it to the beach. There&amp;rsquo;s no cognitive overhead. There&amp;rsquo;s no latency to slow down your thinking. Just speak, or type, and it works.&lt;/p&gt;
