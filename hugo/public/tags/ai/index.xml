      <title>Personal Newsletter (Just for me)</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2023-03-18-personal-newsletter/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I write a lot. Every night. Every day. I&amp;rsquo;m constantly writing. And, unlike many of the people I know who similarly take lots of notes, I also regularly read what I write. However, the nature of how I write leaves my writing messy (full of typos) and disjointed (writing on one topic might be scattered across dozens of pages, with lots of unrelated thoughts interspersed between).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a year ago, I had the idea to hire an editor / writer to help me use all this writing a bit more effectively. My idea at the time was that once a month, I would bundle up everything I&amp;rsquo;d written that month, and send it to my editor. They would read through it, clean up all the typos, and also assemble a monthly newsletter of sorts, just for me. The newsletter would have a section for each major topic in my notes &amp;ndash; each idea that I revisited more than once &amp;ndash; and it would provide a quick recap of my thinking on that topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never hired that editor. Instead, GPT-4 was released, and I implemented this newsletter idea for myself instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-newsletter&#34;&gt;The Newsletter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now receive, courtesy of Bieber Bot and my messager server, a personalized newsletter twice a week. The newsletter contains a bunch of sections: upcoming plans, things I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about, the dominant emotions from the week, etc. Each section is presented in a nice little round-cornered box, with concise text showcasing the highlights from my notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t a newsletter that I would ever send out to an audience &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s highly personal! But receiving it in my inbox is a joy. It reminds me of the people I want to reach out to. It reminds me of all the clever little ideas I had throughout the week, that I might not have thought about again for a while. It reminds me of things I&amp;rsquo;d been meaning to buy or do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Receiving this newsletter helps me connect better with myself by resurfacing all these old ideas I&amp;rsquo;d had throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;newsletter-features&#34;&gt;Newsletter Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions.&lt;/strong&gt; In my first pass at creating the newsletter, I&amp;rsquo;ve given GPT-4 a list of questions to answer using the last 5 days of my notes. The newsletter contains one section per question. Here&amp;rsquo;s the list of questions I started out with, which I expect to refine over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are all my open TODOs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are all the things I want to buy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are all my upcoming plans?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are some ideas I seem to keep revisiting?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are my accomplishments from the past week?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List all the people I wanted to reach out to and what I wanted to say to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the most interesting ideas from my notes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the big recurring themes in my notes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there any things in my notes that didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the dominant emotions found in the notes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digestability.&lt;/strong&gt; For each question, GPT-4 prepares concise content that&amp;rsquo;s easy to digest. It arranges the sections in a 2-column layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citing sources.&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve also asked GPT-4 to include links back to the original notes that it is using to answer the questions. To do this, I include in GPT&amp;rsquo;s view of my notes a unique ID for each note (essentially one ID per block of text). I then have GPT use these ids to cite which notes its using in every sentence that it writes. To me, it&amp;rsquo;s remarkable that this works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-are-you-writing-all-this-to-begin-with&#34;&gt;Why are you writing all this to begin with?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the personal projects I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten the most value out of is called 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/go-note-go/&#34;&gt;Go Note Go&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a headless keyboard (a computer keyboard with no screen) that I can write on or speak to, and anything I write on it (or say to it, after pushing the record button), gets transcribed into my notes (for me, this is Roam Research, but Go Note Go supports 7-8 different note-taking systems, so if you want to use it, I&amp;rsquo;m sure wherever you like to keep your writing is fine.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve found Go Note Go incredibly rewarding. Whether I&amp;rsquo;m driving somewhere, drifting off to sleep, sitting at my desk, or taking a shower, it&amp;rsquo;s there to help me capture any thoughts I want to remember. Unlike a voice memo or Apple Notes, using it isn&amp;rsquo;t disruptive (to myself or others). Even when just sitting at a desk, I get a great sense of relief turning away from my computer monitor toward Go Note Go to write; it&amp;rsquo;s freeing, and helps me think clearly. I could go on about Go Note Go indefinitely, and if you want to learn more or to build your own, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/tags/go-note-go/&#34;&gt;you can do so here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second personal project that I also use to take notes on the go is my personal Voice Assistant. I have a phone number I can call to either leave myself notes or to talk with GPT. These notes / conversations also end up in my notes in Roam, and hence can end up in my newsletter. I prefer this over a standard voice note-taking app because it works well with car play, so I can use it while I&amp;rsquo;m driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;building-the-newsletter&#34;&gt;Building the Newsletter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually building the newsletter was delightful. Using GPT-4 to process my notes was simple using OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s Python API. Despite this simplicity, I found it faster to have GPT-4 itself write the code that constructs the newsletter than to write it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also wanted the newsletter to be stylized nicely, not just a wall of text. I haven&amp;rsquo;t done much front-end development work in recent years, but GPT-4 was happy to write the HTML and CSS to make the email exactly as desired (2 columns of rounded corner sections, each with header and content). The email-sending library I was using (a part of my Messager platform) didn&amp;rsquo;t support sending HTML emails though, but GPT-4 had no trouble updating the library to support this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall GPT-4 made building both the automatically-writing-the-newsletter and assisting-me-writing-the-software-that-creates-and-sends-the-newsletter pieces simple and quite fun.
It reminds me of the childhood joy of learning to program; computers are magic, once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;newsletter-upkeep&#34;&gt;Newsletter Upkeep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect that over the next few weeks, as the first installments of the newsletter start showing up in my email, I&amp;rsquo;ll have lots of tweaks and improvements I&amp;rsquo;ll want to make. For one, I look forward to iterating on the list of questions and sections in the newsletter. I&amp;rsquo;m also likely to add some filtering to my notes before they get sent to GPT, to ensure that personal or confidential pieces aren&amp;rsquo;t sent to OpenAI. I&amp;rsquo;m also likely to refine the &amp;ldquo;preamble&amp;rdquo; and prompts GPT sees, so it has more context about topics I write about frequently, and to better align GPT&amp;rsquo;s output with my morning interests and needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, I&amp;rsquo;m excited to try having GPT use HTML&amp;rsquo;s summary/details feature to create a cleaner newsletter layout while allowing deep dives by expanding the summaries. Additionally, I&amp;rsquo;m enthusiastic about adding deep linking back into Roam, so that I can quickly access my raw notes from anything in the newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d also love to create an experience where simply by clicking on a piece of text in the newsletter, I can start to take the appropriate action on that item. For instance, clicking on a reminder to reach out to someone could open a Gmail draft or Facebook Messenger message draft started by GPT. And If I click on a reminder to buy a backpack, it could open Amazon search results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some items in my notes, it might even make sense for GPT to propose or take actions independently. I&amp;rsquo;m keen on exploring this idea and transforming the newsletter into more of a personal assistant experience for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m confident that I&amp;rsquo;ll have a dozen more ideas and feature requests for myself and for GPT in these coming weeks, and I&amp;rsquo;m delighted to use Go Note Go to keep track of all of them &amp;ndash; only to have them show up in my personal newsletter later in the week. I fully anticipate working with GPT to implement these feature requests to continue improving my newsletter experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusions-courtesy-of-gpt-4&#34;&gt;Conclusions, courtesy of GPT-4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, using GPT-4 to create a personal newsletter has proven to be an effective and enjoyable solution for organizing and revisiting the wealth of ideas and thoughts from daily note-taking. The AI&amp;rsquo;s capabilities in processing and compiling content, as well as its assistance in coding and designing the newsletter, have demonstrated its incredible potential as a developer tool. The resulting personalized newsletter not only helps me in connecting better with myself but also serves as a powerful reminder of my ideas, emotions, and plans that would have otherwise been lost in the chaos of daily life. As GPT-4 continues to evolve, there are endless possibilities for future improvements and applications, making it an invaluable resource for both developers and individuals alike.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Writing a Tampermonkey Script with GPT-4</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2023-03-15-tampermonkey-gpt-4/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2023-03-15-tampermonkey-gpt-4/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I used 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://openai.com/research/gpt-4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GPT-4&lt;/a&gt; to implement my first ever 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tampermonkey.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tampermonkey&lt;/a&gt; script. It took well under half an hour, which is likely many times faster than it would have taken me alone. I am blown away by GPT-4&amp;rsquo;s programming capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started with 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hypothesis/h/issues/7868&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;a simple feature request&lt;/a&gt; for 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://hypothes.is/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;the Hypothesis browser extension&lt;/a&gt;. For context, Hypothesis is a tool for taking notes on the web, including on PDFs.
I use it to take notes on machine learning pdfs on Arxiv. It&amp;rsquo;s a great tool, but it has a limitation: when browsing my notes, it only shows the ID of the pdf, not the name of the PDF. This makes it hard to find what I&amp;rsquo;m looking for.
So, I made a feature request on GitHub, asking if the developers of hypothesis could make the titles of pages editable. This would allow me to replace the useless IDs with the more useful titles on pdfs whenever I take notes on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone suggested I could write a Greasemonkey script to do this. Their exact suggestion was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34;&gt;You can write a Greasemonkey script which parses the Arxiv PDF links on Hypothesis pages, gathers their ArxivID, queries the Arxiv ATOM API with one HTTP call (using an aggregated list of ArxivIDs as a search parameter) and updates Arxiv PDF links titles on Hypothesis pages.

Example of an API query with multiple ArxivIDs: https://export.arxiv.org/api/query?id_list=2007.12026,1706.03741,1603.00022
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I thought this wasn&amp;rsquo;t such a helpful suggestion. Writing a Greasemonkey script is time consuming and it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be worthwhile for such a small usability improvement. Then I remembered GPT-4. So, I decided to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greasemonkey is for Firefox. Tampermonkey is the equivalent for Chrome. I use Chrome, so I would need a Tampermonkey script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used GPT-4 to write the script. This is not a trivial script by any stretch of the imagination. It involves parsing the DOM on the Hypothesis page to find references to Arxiv, querying the Arxiv API (but only after dividing the IDs into batches), parsing the XML results returned by the API, and again parsing and updating the DOM on the Hypothesis page to update the results. In order to do all this, the developer needs to understand what the DOM looks like on the Hypothesis page, and what the format of the Arxiv API results XML looks like, in order to get the parsing correct. It took a few back-and-forths, but GPT-4 did a remarkable job of writing the script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what our interaction looked like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34;&gt;1. Me (Initial prompt): `Write a tampermonkey script that parses the Arxiv PDF links on Hypothesis pages, gathers their ArxivID, queries the Arxiv ATOM API with one HTTP call (using an aggregated list of ArxivIDs as a search parameter) and updates Arxiv PDF links titles on Hypothesis pages.`

GPT-4: &amp;lt;Attempt 1 at script&amp;gt;

2. Me: `The HTML for one of the rows on the hypothesis page is:
...
In this example the text to update is &amp;quot;1904.09751.pdf&amp;quot; which should be replaced with the title`

GPT-4: &amp;lt;Attempt 2 at script&amp;gt;

3. Me: How do I view the script&#39;s logs if it isn&#39;t working?

GPT-4: Explains how to get the logs

4. Me: _&amp;lt;pastes error message&amp;gt;_

GPT-4: _&amp;lt;Fixes error message&amp;gt;_

5. Me: Here is the format returned by the arxiv.org api call we&#39;re making: _&amp;lt;pastes example Arxiv API output&amp;gt;_

Notice the arxiv id can end with e.g. v1 -- we can safely strip that part.
Let&#39;s also add debug logging, e.g. logging the arxivIDs found on the hypothesis page and any other useful debug info

GPT-4: _&amp;lt;Fixes the v1 stripping and adds logging&amp;gt;_

6. Me: The arxiv API only returns the results for the first 10 ids passed to it.

GPT-4: _&amp;lt;Adds batching of API calls&amp;gt;_

7. Me: _&amp;lt;Describes an edge case&amp;gt;_: The title can also be something like 1607.06450v1.pdf -- in that case we should get the id as 1607.06450, dropping the &amp;quot;v1&amp;quot; part

GPT-4: _&amp;lt;Handles the edge case&amp;gt;_
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/dbieber/c3198a1ceeb86fa823df305a76907afa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the final script it came up with.&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s 112 lines of reasonably well organized Javascript. And it gets the job done. Now, when I visit my Hypothesis notes, the title of every paper is shown clearly, not just its inscrutable Arxiv ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the abbreviated transcript above, there were only seven back-and-forths between me and the model. In that time, the model behaved sensibly all throughout. It never once made a silly slip-up, which was common behavior for previous models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those seven back-and-forths, I used one (1) to share the overall task, four (2, 5, 6, and 7) to share information about the data being manipulated, one (3) to ask for help, and one (4) to paste an error message for GPT to debug.
If I&amp;rsquo;d had more foresight, I expect I could have included the data from (2, 5, 6, and 7) all in my initial query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During development, I would manually copy GPT-4&amp;rsquo;s code into Tampermonkey, save it, and refresh Hypothesis to see the changes. If I got an error, or if the behavior wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly what I wanted, I simply told GPT and waited for it to update the code. GPT-4&amp;rsquo;s output generation is slow compared to other AI models, and there was some waiting time as it wrote its responses. I really felt like I had delegated work to an AI worker, and could easily see myself managing a fleet of such workers, all working toward different goals concurrently. I can also see a future where one AI worker is itself responsible for delegating work to a fleet of such workers; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be a human doing all that delegation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, GPT-4 behaved as a professional and speedy developer throughout the entire duration of the task. I would be delighted to work with them again on future projects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whoa! Hello there! Can&amp;rsquo;t wait to learn what you can do!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say &amp;ldquo;Can you check the time for me?&amp;rdquo; and you walk over to a clock and look at it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you see how much shampoo is left?&lt;br/&gt;
Send me a picture of what&amp;rsquo;s in the fridge.&lt;br/&gt;
Take out the trash.&lt;br/&gt;
Check if the milk is spoiled and put it in the trash.&lt;br/&gt;
Very gently move the jigsaw puzzle into the other room.&lt;br/&gt;
Quick! Unplug the toaster!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put out the fire.&lt;br/&gt;
Can you plug my phone in, please?&lt;br/&gt;
Open the window?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s rearrange the furniture &amp;ndash; where do you think the couch should go?&lt;br/&gt;
Can you check what page I was on in my book? I think it&amp;rsquo;s on the couch.&lt;br/&gt;
Can you help me find my keys?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Help me install this sconce.&lt;br/&gt;
Make the bed.&lt;br/&gt;
Do the dishes.&lt;br/&gt;

Please have breakfast ready at 8am.&lt;br/&gt;
Do you remember if I brushed my teeth yet?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s work out together.&lt;br/&gt;
Let&amp;rsquo;s dance.&lt;br/&gt;
Now, let&amp;rsquo;s play a board game.&lt;br/&gt;
Can you write a letter?&lt;br/&gt;
Can you write a letter in my handwriting??&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put on this motion capture device, we&amp;rsquo;re going to calibrate you.&lt;br/&gt;
Bring me my own motion capture device &amp;ndash; I want to collect some practice demonstrations for you.&lt;br/&gt;
I seem to have left my motion capture device in New Haven, so watch carefully &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m going to show you how I clean the mirror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I pick up this bottle, and I make sure the spray nozzle is set to the on position. It says &amp;ldquo;On&amp;rdquo; here.&lt;br/&gt;
Then I point the bottle at the mirror and spray like this, pulling the trigger to spray.&lt;br/&gt;
I wipe the wet off the mirror to remove any dirt that built up.&lt;br/&gt;
Now you try.&lt;br/&gt;
Oh, the way I know if I succeeded is the mirror looks clean!&lt;br/&gt;
Give it a few tries. You&amp;rsquo;ll figure it out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh wow, you got it on your first try &amp;ndash; I guess this isn&amp;rsquo;t a new skill for you?&lt;br/&gt;
Oh, someone taught you on a different mirror somewhere else around the world, so you already knew how to do this.&lt;br/&gt;
But you still had to figure out how to do it in this new environment, and you did great!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you clean up the mess you made when you dropped that plate earlier?&lt;br/&gt;
Ouch! You rolled over the dog&amp;rsquo;s tail!&lt;br/&gt;
Negative reward! &amp;ldquo;No&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;No&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Bad robot&amp;hellip;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Very good!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh wow, thank you for this unprompted gift &amp;ndash; yes, you get reward for that, that was wonderful, that was very kind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for the elbow pat, little robot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to oil your joints!&lt;br/&gt;
Let&amp;rsquo;s order some new oil for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, encoding your reward to just my voice doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem sufficient with the hacks going around &amp;ndash; we&amp;rsquo;ll need a password or 2fa chip as well.&lt;br/&gt;
What a shame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does it make you sad that I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about buying a newer model?&lt;br/&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m gonna miss you everyday, Robbie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thoughts on ChatGPT</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2022-12-08-thoughts-on-chatgpt/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2022-12-08-thoughts-on-chatgpt/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This blog post was entirely written by me, David Bieber, a human being. I did not consult with ChatGPT or Bieber Bot or any other assistants or conversational agents in the writing of this post. It is likely this will now be a rare occurrence, and that subsequent posts will generally be written with an assistant at my side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reminder-this-is-a-snippet&#34;&gt;Reminder: This is a snippet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this were an ordinary blog post, I might set aside some space to bring you up to speed with what ChatGPT is (it&amp;rsquo;s a conversational assistant &amp;ndash; a chatbot &amp;ndash; but more sophisticated than SmarterChild ever dreamed she could be). But this is a snippet, a mini blog post written for no audience and with no quality bar to publication, so I will press on without doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reactions-to-chatgpt&#34;&gt;Reactions to ChatGPT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futility. Existential dread. Unsettled. Excitement! There are lots of possible reasons one might be concerned about the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI. For me, the ones that hit me hardest were about my own ability to stay relevant a few years down the line. Bear in mind, when you hear this concern, that it&amp;rsquo;s not just about ChatGPT&amp;rsquo;s current capabilities. It&amp;rsquo;s about the expected advancements that are coming in the next several months or years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not concerned about being &amp;ldquo;replaced&amp;rdquo; wholesale. I am concerned about my own ability to stay relevant and continue to provide (as significant) value professionally and personally a few year&amp;rsquo;s down the line, heightening competition and expectations, a future need to be always on / always adapting to a world changing faster each year. An economic future full of contradictions I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to wrap my head around yet. And a large number of people who are going to have sudden shifts in their lives, jobs, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I previously thought self-driving trucks would be the one Big Shock, and everything else would get automated more gradually (in terms of people/year). I&amp;rsquo;m in the process of reconsidering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;expected-advancements&#34;&gt;Expected Advancements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future capabilities will include

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.adept.ai/act&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;taking actions&lt;/a&gt; on your computer, and accessing your personal files (documents, emails, chats, etc) (with your permission, of course). We&amp;rsquo;re also going to see major improvements in quality from human feedback, and from a larger model trained on more data. I expect this is coming quite soon. A bit further down the line, integration of multiple modalities (e.g. image generation, audio, video) will come too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-chatgpt-with-my-roam-research-notes&#34;&gt;Using ChatGPT with my Roam Research Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/projects/go-note-go&#34;&gt;Go Note Go&lt;/a&gt; to jot down miscellaneous thoughts. They are often scattered and always ill-formatted. ChatGPT is able to pull out a clean list of TODOs from my notes, unperturbed by the messy format they start in. Integrating conversational assistants into more of my personal documents is going to be immensely valuable. Excited to see what progress on retrieval augmented models brings next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;building-products-with-chatgpt&#34;&gt;Building Products with ChatGPT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voice assistant:&lt;/strong&gt; Tonight I prototyped a voice conversational assistant with Twilio using GPT-3.5 (davinci-text-003). I&amp;rsquo;m excited to try it out with ChatGPT as well. Being able to place a phone call to use the power of a conversational assistant is convenient, especially when driving. There, a phone call is easy but a text based app is not safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical robo-intake:&lt;/strong&gt; At the doctor&amp;rsquo;s office, you typical fill out an intake form which is impersonal. Then, if the doctor is busy, you may not get to tell them all the details that could be relevant to your case. Using a conversational assistant to perform the medical intake could be quite valuable. We wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be relying on the AI to have robust medical knowledge or make any diagnosis; it would simply ask relevant questions to try to elicit any details that might be pertinent for the doctor to know. The doctor could still see the full conversation, as well as a robo-summary with the highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal tutor:&lt;/strong&gt; One drawback of the current ChatGPT system is it isn&amp;rsquo;t always factual, making it challenging to use for learning unfamiliar subject matter. I envision a system in which a human tutor can view their student&amp;rsquo;s conversations with an AI-tutor, and can jump in with corrections and suggestions when needed. Another important aspect of an AI personal tutor will be curriculum setting (involving push messages, not just reactive messages), and goal setting, but the most important aspect is just that you can go down whatever rabbit-hole tangents catch your eye while progressing through the guided lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teddy Bear Programmer:&lt;/strong&gt; ChatGPT already provides a great developer experience, where you can ask it technical questions or to perform code-writing tasks. To improve this experience, we can build a system where it always has visibility into the context of your development efforts. E.g. it can see your recent terminal usage or your current editor window. So when you ask it questions, it knows why you&amp;rsquo;re asking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Clink&amp;rdquo; Feature for Go Note Go:&lt;/strong&gt; The idea here is that when you take notes on Go Note Go, and someone else also has taken notes, you should be able to &amp;ldquo;clink&amp;rdquo; your two note-bases in order to find points of commonality between you. Then you can hit it off and discuss your common interests! The ChatGPT tech makes implementing this easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-own-uses-of-chatgpt-so-far&#34;&gt;My Own Uses of ChatGPT so Far&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing a legal document&lt;/strong&gt; for a car sharing agreement for my partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing a blog post&lt;/strong&gt; on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2022-12-03-spicy-conversations/&#34;&gt;the salt, fat, acid, heat metaphor&lt;/a&gt;. Revising the post was done with the help of ChatGPT as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning&lt;/strong&gt; about variational autoencoders, about music theory, violin and guitar, and about Rust and building Chrome Extensions, and about topics in medicine, history, and science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programming&lt;/strong&gt; in languages I&amp;rsquo;m less familiar with and using APIs I&amp;rsquo;m unfamiliar with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading papers&lt;/strong&gt; and having ChatGPT summarize sections as I read them. Similarly, having ChatGPT summarize websites and blog posts as I browse the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extracting clean TODOs&lt;/strong&gt; from my messy Go Note Go notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generating descriptions&lt;/strong&gt; for Stable Diffusion, which in turn generates stunning imagery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brainstorming&lt;/strong&gt; uses of ChatGPT, questions to ask people, thoughts on education and psychology, topics in medicine, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just for fun&lt;/strong&gt; generating simple stories, bad jokes, poor stand up comedy routines, and silly parody songs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;excitement-for-the-future&#34;&gt;Excitement for the future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite my visceral reactions of futility and existential dread noted above&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m excited and energized for the future. There&amp;rsquo;s no doubt this technology is going to provide a tremendous amount of value and it&amp;rsquo;s going to come quick.
Yes, the space of possible futures seems narrower today than it did before the ChatGPT launch.
Now we must aim for the best possible future among all those that remain open.
And ultimately, does not every passing moment narrow the space of possible futures?
The space of &lt;em&gt;proximal&lt;/em&gt; possible futures, on the other hand, has now been pried wide open.
Machine-learning driven conversational assistants present so many possibilities.
My brainstormings so far only scratch the surface.
I&amp;rsquo;m excited to get building, and to unearth more about what this tech is doing to our future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Want to build together? Get in touch!)&lt;/p&gt;
